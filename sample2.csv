1000,"Whilst welcoming the Prime Minister's reply, may I ask him to explain why, when he first answered Questions in this House after seeing President Kennedy, he could not reveal what had transpired between the President and himself, other than what was in the communiqué because the talks were private, secret and confidential,  yet is now giving further information to his hon. Friends that is not in the communiqué. Why can he give private and confidential information on some things and not on others?","Mr. A. Lewis","This was mentioned in the communiqué but, if I have gone a little beyond it, I must apologise to the House.",1962-05-10,0.0261
1500,"Since the views of the people of this country should be heard on this question before a final decision is taken and since this honourable House is supposed to represent the people of the country, would not the Prime Minister consider at least the desirability of giving a free vote on the occasion so that Members of Parliament will take their full responsibility in voting on behalf of their constituents?","Mr. J. Hynd","I will, of course, take note of that, but I think all I have said is still true, that we ought to go on with the negotiations, bring them to an end, see what the Government themselves make up their mind to recommend and then, as the hon. Gentleman says, let the House judge.",1962-11-20,0.0523
2000,"Having mentioned posters, is the Prime Minister aware that the poster advertising interests are in effect exercising a censorship over Government posters dealing with the connection between smoking and lung cancer?

2500,":Can the Prime Minister at any rate confirm that this Committee is the Committee referred to in both Houses as the Powell Committee? Why should its terms of reference be considered so secret in view of the evidencegiven to the Select Committee and the discussions in another place yesterday? Can the Prime Minister say whether it is proposed to take any action in view of the criticism made from both sides in another place yesterday about the lack of decision and of policy of the Government on nuclear energy?","Mr. Albu",":This is a complicated question, as I think the hon. Member will agree. The Government  take note of the views expressed by the Select Committee and will study them carefully.

Does not he regard the post-election Honours Lists as the Establishment equivalent to the E.T.U. "ballot rigging" exercise—the lists from both sides of this House—and will not he consider, if not legislation, setting up a committee consisting of my hon. Friends the Members for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot) and South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) and myself to examine this question objectively?","Mr. Hamilton","I am not quite sure about the millions referred to by my hon. Friend, who has obviously acquainted himself with their contempt for the honours system, but I know from my postbag that there are many millions more who have a very lively interest in it.",1964-12-15,0.13
4500,"Will the right hon. Gentleman bear in mind that there has been and still is considerable public disquiet about this matter? If he receives any report in the future from any authorities, will he give it serious consideration and follow it up with action?","Sir J. Langford-Holt","I share the disquiet expressed. There has been a considerable improvement recently in stockholding and the transferring of surpluses, as a result of the installation of computers, but there are still anxieties about the methods of their disposal as well as of their ordering. As I have said, the Ministers are looking into this. If we find that there is a case for any kind of Ministerial or general inquiry we shall not hesitate to institute it.",1965-04-27,0.1051
5000,"I must explain to the right hon. Gentleman once again— If the hon. Member for Fife, West (Mr. William Hamilton) will contain himself for a moment, he will hear the answer.  Why should the Leader of the Opposition or any other right hon. Gentleman be given preferential treatment at Question Time? Is he permitted only to ask a question, or is he to be permitted to make a statement, contrary to the treatment meted out to back bench members? Why should the Leader of the Opposition or any other right hon. Gentleman be given preferential treatment at Question Time? Is he permitted only to ask a question, or is he to be permitted to make a statement, contrary to the treatment meted out to back bench members? Is not the Prime Minister aware that I have always made it clear that I was in favour of the idea of the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Mission but that from the moment it was clear that the right hon. Gentleman had failed to prepare it it was doomed to failure.","Sir Alec Douglas-Home","Yes, Sir. That is exactly what the right hon. Gentleman said in his speech on Tuesday. I agree that that is exactly what he said. The point which I was putting to him was that since such leading Commonwealth Prime Ministers as Sir Robert Menzies had supported it from the outset, knowing all about the preparations, knowing that we could not endanger the Mission by allowing the Chinese to get at it first, the right hon. Gentleman is therefore condemning some senior Commonwealth Prime Ministers who have far more experience and knowledge of world affairs than he has himself.",1965-07-22,0.0564
5500,"Is the right hon. Gentleman going to treat this national emergency as an excuse for making yet another party political broadcast this weekend, well read, as usual, off the teleprompter?","Sir W. Bromley-Davenport","I had not thought about the question of broadcasting.

Yesterday we were informed that it was appointed ex officio and that its membership could be varied only by the Conference of Prime Ministers. As there is now no President of Ghana and no Prime Minister of Nigeria, what is its present membership?","Mr. G. Campbell","The hon. Gentleman will be aware that contacts between Commonwealth Prime Ministers do not depend only on annual conferences or on conferences at infrequent intervals. If we had been given any encouragement at all for the view that the Mission would be received, we could within a matter of 24 hours reach agreement on the composition of the Mission.",1966-06-21,0.4302
6500,"How many men will be redeployed from the motor industry into other export industries?","Mr. Heath","It is not possible at this stage to make that forecast. The right hon. Gentleman may have heard that there was a debate in the House for a whole day on redeployment in the motor car industry. If he had been following that debate instead of conducting his pantomime about Standing Order No. 9, he might know more about it.",1966-11-03,0.1869

7500,"As the right hon. Gentleman is obviously aware that this Report is awaited with a great deal of interest, can he say whether he will himself make a statement when it is published?","Mr. Peyton","Yes, Sir, and I think that that is the usual position. The hon. Gentleman will, of course, know that it is the hope of the Government to publish this information in full, in so far as this is possible, but that on these occasions there are discussions with the Leader of the Opposition about any deletions which might be necessary on security grounds.",1967-05-04,0.0069
8000,"Does the Prime Minister recall that it is now nine months since he was advised that there were urgent matters awaiting his discussion in Moscow, such as Russian aid to North Vietnam, and Mr. Gerald Brooke? Can the right hon. Gentleman, in the meantime, make it quite clear to Mr. Kosygin that he has no intention of dissociating further from the American fight for freedom in Vietnam?","Mr. Marten","I am aware that it is now nine months since my last  meeting with Mr. Kosygin, but I do not think that either of us envisaged that we should get into a kind of commuter relationship with one another. The hon. Gentleman earlier this year expressed some cynicism about the absence of a "hot line". He will be glad to know that it is in operation, and that I have been able to communicate with Mr. Kosygin on certain of the subjects which he has just mentioned. With regard to discussions with Mr. Kosygin about Vietnam, this would, I think, be within the context of my discussions with him last February, which were reported to the House.",1967-11-14,0.2083
8500,"asked the Prime Minister whether the public speech by the Lord President of the Council in London on 19th January dealing with separate Parliaments for Wales and Scotland represents Government policy.","Mr. Elystan Morgan","My right hon. Friend did not make a speech, Sir, but was taking part in a television discussion. A transcript of that discussion is in the Library and if hon. Members would care to read it they will find that my right hon. Friend made no statement of policy on these matters.",1968-02-27,0.175

Secondly, does he agree that before we sign the United Nations or the European Convention of Human Rights, we must have provision against religious discrimination in all parts of the United Kingdom?","Mr. Whitaker","I will certainly bear in mind what my hon.

Was it not out of order for the hon. and gallant Member for Down, South (Captain Orr) to seek to raise such a point of order after you had called me for a supplementary question, Mr. Speaker?","Mr. MacDermot","This point was made when my right hon. Friend the then Home Secretary and I discussed this matter with the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and certain of his colleagues. I do not under-estimate the Prime Minister's difficulties, nor, indeed, the extent to which, for example, in the national franchise—the Parliamentary franchise—he has moved a long way ahead of a great deal of reactionary public opinion in his country. I know that it is his desire also to do that in local government. I do not under-estimate the difficulties, nor the impatience of my hon. Friends in this matter.",1968-10-22,0.121
10000,"asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his visit to Germany.","Mr. Marten","The House will realise that my talks with the Federal German Chancellor were confidential.

Members to the Joint Declaration issued at the end of the talks in Bonn which I will, with permission, circulate in the OFFICIAL REPORT.",1969-02-18,0.0326
10500,"The main part of the Secretary of State's speech was about participation. Is my right hon. Friend aware that the Secretary of State's remarks were very welcome and that they have done a great deal to stabilise the situation in the universities? Will he encourage his other Ministers to make speeches about participation on very much the same theme in relation to hospitals, planning procedures and, in particular, the introduction of some industrial democracy into this country?","Mr. Price","My right hon. Friend's speech in part dealt with the question of the universities. He condemned the small minority who stop other students from studying. He stressed the importance of the comprehensive schools  in developing students who will be able to take a full part and participate in new ideas. I agree with my right hon. Friend that some students, with their remonstrations and other behaviour at a young age, are showing many of the destructive, negative and giggling characteristics of hon. Members oposite.",1969-05-22,0.1928
11000,"Will my right hon. Friend recall a passage in his speech when he dealt with visible trade balances, and recall that, according to earlier statistics, this country has comparatively rarely had a favourable balance of visible trade since the American colonies got their independence? In those circumstances will he supply the Leader of the Opposition with figures for any coast-to-coast broadcast that the Leader of the Opposition may wish to make about an independent British economy?","Mr. Fraser","The right hon. Gentleman has all the figures, and gives a great deal of thought to them. It is  a fact that over remembered times it has been very rare for us to have a surplus in visible trade month in and month out. It has required the invisible balances and other factors to produce the figures that I gave at the Guildhall. They will shortly be brought further up to date when we publish the balance of payments figures for the third quarter.",1969-12-02,0.2864
11500,"Does the Prime Minister agree that it would be useful to have consultations with the Governments of other countries which may also be applying for membership of E.E.C., particularly on matters on which so far there is no Common Market policy, such as discussions on fishing with the Norwegians?","Mr. Grimond","We are in close touch with the other applicants, including Ireland. We are in touch with E.F.T.A., with the Irish Government and with the neutral countries on all these matters, but I am doubtful whether there would be a case for a collective meeting of the applicants and those others who are primarily concerned, whether in E.F.T.A. or otherwise.",1970-04-07,0.4585
12000,"Why does the right hon. Gentleman insist on the hypocrisy that he is concerned with keeping down food prices when he has appointed as Minister of Agriculture a man who thinks that the nation has been mollycoddled by cheap food and acts, as a matter of policy, to raise food prices? Why cannot he come to the House and say that this is his policy?","Mr. Buchan","Because, as my right hon. Friend has explained, he wishes, and the Government wish, to give British farmers the opportunity to expand food production and save on imports. This was the declared policy of the last Administration which they never had the courage to carry out.",1970-11-10,0.3991
12500,"Is not one of the three or four key members of the Cabinet, who chooses to make a highly provocative speech introducing the Defence Estimates, to be exposed not to the cosiness of the House of Lords but, if necessary, to the ribaldry and hostility of the House of Commons?","Mr. Dalyell","This is a very old argument, which the hon. Gentleman seems quite incapable of dropping. My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Defence, who is in the House of Lords, holds that office because I consider him to be a most suitable person as Secretary of State for Defence. As we have a bi-cameral system I believe that it is right to work that system by having senior members of the Government in both Houses.",1971-03-30,0.2429

Members  are successful in getting meetings with Ministers they are referred to junior Ministers, and that junior Ministers, however sympathetic they may be to the case made out, are unable to make a decision because of their lack of authority, the result being that the Minister in charge has to make a decision without hearing the case?","Mr. Swain","I do not think I can accept that, either. One of the developments in government of the last 10 or 15 years has been that junior Ministers have had specific tasks allocated to them. Administrations of both parties have found it impossible to continue government, especially with the large Departments now being created, if only one Minister at the top has to see everyone, answer every question at every debate in the House, and deal with every single issue. I though it was the general wish that Ministers other than Secretaries of State should have specific responsibilities and be able to deal directly with hon. Members.",1971-07-06,0.2162
13500,"Will the Prime Minister tell us why lie now refuses to answer Questions about letters received on different subjects when this information has been readily available in the past both from him and from his predecessor? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that some hon. Members on this side of the House regard his determination to answer no Question if it can be avoided as a gross abuse of the House? What he is trying to do is to cover up the deception that he used to win the election and the total incompetence that he has shown since.","Mr. Price","The hon. Gentleman is wrong. In the last Session I answered more Questions than any Prime Minister before me.",1971-12-09,0.142
14000,"When my right hon. Friend next meets the T.U.C. will he point out that the Government, by reducing taxation substantially, and to C.B.I., by its price initiative since last July, are playing their part in the battle against rising prices, and that it is reasonable to expect leading trade unionists to adopt a responsible attitude towards extravagant wage claims?","Mr. Kenneth Baker","Yes, Sir. I believe that that is absolutely right. Proof has now been given that the Government are playing their part and that the C.B.I. and its members are acting effectively. I  therefore hope that the T.U.C. will be able to implement a policy of wage restraint. I fully recognise that these words are, of themselves, not acceptable to trade unionists who dislike the use of the word "restraint". Nevertheless, the importance of seeing that wages do not outrun producivity should be recognised.",1972-03-28,0.5028
14500,"Is there not a long history of fruitful co-operation between Conservative Governments and the trade union movement? Is not the trade union movement full of patriotic people who want the good of this country, and is it not therefore in the interests of the country that fruitful discussions should now take place between the Government and the representatives of the trade union movement to try to see that the economy proceeds on sound lines for the benefit of everyone?","Mr. Biggs-Davison","Yes, Sir. There has been a considerable number of meetings between the General Council, the Economic Committee and the General  Purposes Committee of the TUC with myself and my colleagues over the past two years. These have been valuable. The House knows of the invitation which I gave to the TUC last Wednesday, which it is considering further tomorrow. Its main purpose in coming to see me was to discuss the Industrial Relations Act. I expressed the Government's view on that in the debate in the House on Monday of last week, and I discussed with the General Council again the position which I have set out.",1972-07-11,0.0301

Can he confirm newspaper reports that the Prime Ministers of New Zealand and Australia have both said that they have no plans at present for withdrawing from that agreement?","Mr. Lamont","There have been a number of communications between myself and the new Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand since they took office, but it is customary to keep them confidential. On the specific point raised by my hon. Friend, since the election the Prime Minister of Australia has indicated that the Australian battalion will stay in Singapore until 1st January 1974, and the Prime Minister of New Zealand has said that he will not take any initiative in removing the New Zealand battalion. My right hon. and noble Friend the Secretary of State for Defence is to  visit Australia and New Zealand, amongst other countries, in January and he will then have the opportunity of carrying on talks with the Ministers there.",1972-12-19,0.5084

Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) made of his supplementary question, may I ask the Prime Minister, in an attempt to use his time rather more seriously, to say a little more about the recent discussions among some of the NATO allies about the proposal to create a European nuclear command? Will he resist any attempt that might be made in the discussion he is to hold with the President of France or other NATO members to enlarge the sphere of nuclear armament and adhere strictly to the treaty against the spreading of nuclear arms to other countries?","Mr. John Mendelson","Yes, Sir, of course we shall adhere to that treaty. We have signed it and we shall stick to it.",1973-11-08,0.0367

Gentleman aware that all I am asking for is to have someone on the Government Front Bench upon whom I can vent the anger and indignation of my constituents, and of millions of people throughout the Greater London area, following the 85 per cent. increase in the GLC rating demand—an anger which in Bromley has been intensified and accentuated by the Government's rate support grant proposals?","Mr. Hunt","The hon. Gentleman should be venting his wrath on the Opposition Front Bench and not on the Government. The hon. Gentleman will know that as a result of the Government's action there was an improvement in these matters. The hon. Gentleman's party did not vote against that action on any convincing scale.",1974-04-04,0.1039

Will my right hon. Friend say that he agrees with those hon. Members who believe that the campaign is dangerously close to a total misuse of the so-called public right to know?","Mr. Whitehead","I entirely agree with my hon. Friend. What is particularly nauseating is the sanctimonious spirit in which this has been done.

20000,"During the Summit meeting did the Prime Minister manage to discover from the French President why, since February 1974, prices have risen twice as much in Great Britain as they have in France, and why unemployment has risen much more than in France? When speaking to the President, did the Prime Minister take any pride in the fact that Britain is at the top, or the bottom, according to which way one looks at it, of the league—in other words, worse on prices and worse on unemployment than any other member of the Community?","Mr. Tebbit","I did not discuss 1974 with the President because the reason is well known—that the Conservative Administration allowed the money supply to get totally out of control. Whereas when we came into office the M3 figure—which is the index frequently used—was over 27 per cent., as the hon. Gentleman may have seen from statistics which were  published at 2.30 p.m. today, it is now down to 13·4 per cent. and will keep within the 9 per cent. to 13 per cent. level. Therefore, we do not have far to seek for the reasons for inflation. The hon.

It is not a moral question, but a question of how we manage to ensure that the jobs of the people of this country are safeguarded, that inflation does not get out of hand and that prices do not go up. On that basis, we have decided to take certain actions. I am certain that we are right and that, despite the dilemma, the public understand, why we are doing it.

The right hon. Gentleman underestimates the excellence of the package which my right hon. Friend gained. No Labour Minister of Agriculture managed to secure a freeze on milk prices. The results on the butter subsidy which my right hon. Friend gained were excellent. The net effect of his work is that this country is £30 million better off than it would otherwise have been without it. I might add that those farmers who, without my right hon.

Given a 6 per cent. forecast fall in national output for this year and next year, we face the biggest slump since the 1930s, yet the money supply—on which altar the real economy has been sacrificed—is escalating out of control at twice the Government's target.

Already, record investment in education has produced the best school results this country has ever seen. We see from today's report by the chief executive of the national health service that most indicators in the NHS are moving in the right, positive direction, although there is a lot more to do.

Can I encourage the Prime Minister to work with Members on both sides of the House who recognise the need for welfare reform, starting with the shadow Health Secretary, who has broken ranks to support a housing benefit cap? (21199)","Andrew Selous","My hon. Friend makes a very good point. We do need a debate about how we tackle the welfare system and get it under control. One of the best places to start with housing benefit is the Labour manifesto, personally written by the right hon. Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband). It said clearly— Well, they all stood on it, so they should be reminded of it. It said:“Housing Benefit will be reformed to ensure that we do not subsidise people to live in the private sector on rents that other ordinary working families could not afford.”The level of opportunism is so great that even when we introduce their policies they oppose them.",2010-11-03,0.2927

Carbon trading by its very nature requires a common price, not a unilateral one, so will he suspend that price and send his Chancellor into the European Union to negotiate a common price and ensure that we have a level playing field for inward investment?","Geraint Davies","I respect the hon. Gentleman’s views, but I do not agree with him. I think the steps taken in the Budget are right, and we should judge companies such as Tata by the investments that they make. I have been hugely heartened by the fact that Tata is putting more investment into the UK. Its Redcar plant closed under the previous Government, but it is going to reopen in part because of the investment that Tata is making. I will of course listen to the hon.

Friend makes an important point. In fact, a major financial institution warned yesterday of the dangers of investing in Scotland while there is this uncertainty about the future of the constitution under way. I think it is very important that we keep our United Kingdom together and we stress that when it comes to vital industries like green technology, the combination of a green investment bank sponsored by the United Kingdom Government and the many natural advantages that there are in Scotland can make this a great industry for people in Scotland—but we will do that only if we keep our country together.",2011-11-02,0.2831

They were  both courageous and highly respected men who were engaged in the vitally important work of training and mentoring the Afghan police, and their service to our nation must never be forgotten.This morning I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others.

(135528)","Meg Hillier","The point about the child benefit change is that 85% of families who receive child benefit will go on getting it. The question we all have to ask is whether it is right for people earning £20,000 or £30,000 to go on giving child benefit to people earning £70,000, £80,000 or £90,000.

52500,"The reality is that the Prime Minister makes choices, and he has made a choice concerning working tax credits that has not worked very well so far. I shall give him an example. A serving soldier, a private in the Army with two children and a partner, would lose over £2,000 next April. I ask the question— Thank you, Mr Speaker. Surely it is the whole point of our Parliament that we are able to put questions to those in authority.I have a question from Kieran, a veteran of the first Gulf war. His family are set to lose out, and he writes:“It’s a worry to the family…There’s fear and trepidation about whether we’re going to be able to get by”,and he asks:“Is that how this government treats veterans of the Armed Forces?”","Jeremy Corbyn","Let me take the case of the serving soldier. Many soldiers—indeed, I think all soldiers—will benefit from the £11,000 personal allowance that comes in next year. That means they will be able to earn more money before they even start paying taxes. Serving soldiers that have children will benefit from the   hours of childcare, and of course serving soldiers and others will be able to see our proposals on tax credits in exactly three weeks’ time. What I would say to the serving soldier is that he is now dealing with an Opposition party whose leader said he could not see any use for UK forces anywhere in the world at any time.

When my constituency was badly flooded, some insurance companies paid out quickly, but others were not so fast. When we look at what happened during the winter, we see that 82% of claims have been paid out, but if colleagues have specific examples the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs will be interested to see them so that we can get on top of the insurance industry.

Gentleman what has happened over the past seven years. We have seen record numbers of people in employment—nearly 3 million more people in work. We have seen the introduction of the national living wage—never done by Labour, but introduced by a Conservative Government. We have seen 4 million people taken out of paying income tax altogether and a cut in income tax and a change in the personal allowance that is the equivalent of £1,000 a year to basic rate taxpayers, including nurses.

54500,"The Prime Minister is responsible for the underfunding of the Welsh Government and the needs of Wales. Despite that, the overall Welsh Labour Government health budget has grown by 5% in 2016-17. It is Labour Wales that has a problem of underfunding from a Conservative Government based in Westminster. So far this winter, 100,000 patients have been forced to wait more than 30 minutes in the back of an ambulance in NHS England, for which she is responsible, yet still she refuses to give the NHS the money that it needs. Can she tell us how many more patients will face life-threatening waits in the back of ambulances this winter?","Jeremy Corbyn","I say to the right hon. Gentleman that of course we want to ensure that people are not waiting in those ambulances, but the only answer that he ever comes up with is on the question of money. The question— No, the question is this: why are there some hospitals where the percentage of patients waiting more than 30 minutes is zero and other hospitals where the percentage of patients waiting more than 30 minutes is considerably higher? If he wants to talk about funding, perhaps we should look at what the Labour party promised at the last general election last year.  It is all very well shadow Ministers shouting about the comparison of money. The point is that, at the last election, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said this:“Labour and the Conservatives are pretty much on the same page…there’s not much to choose between them in terms of the money they’ll put into the NHS.”",2018-01-24,0.2181
