147,"Does the Prime Minister agree with his colleagues behind him that this is a laughing matter? Does he realise that his handling of this very serious Berlin problem has been marked by abject failure, and will he try to do something better?",Mr. Hughes,What I try to do is to answer the Questions that the hon. and learned Gentleman addresses to me.,24/10/1961,0.0949,0,,,
294,"When the right hon. Gentleman takes full responsibility for this shocking state of affairs, can he tell us whether, in this particular instance, he has not been able to find a convenient scapegoat on whom to shuffle his own responsibility?",Mr. M. Foot,"I have a little sympathy with the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. M. Foot) on that point, because he is a kind of born scapegoat.",23/11/1961,0.0171,0,,,
441,"But will the Prime Minister answer the second part of my supplementary question? Will he, in particular, say whether Sir Roy Welensky has any right to threaten to prevent the transport of United Nations' bombs through the Federal Territory into  Katanga for what he publicly states are reasons of foreign policy?",Mr. Healey,"Whether he is right or not he would have no power to do so. With regard to the other part of the hon. Gentleman's supplementary question, the Federal Government have actually been most helpful in trying to prevent the flow of arms through their territory. This is a very long frontier, some 2,000 miles in all, and it is a fairly difficult task to be absolutely secure.",14/12/1961,0.3184,1,,,
588,"With a view to getting the best possible atmosphere for the Geneva Conference, will the Prime Minister consider using his influence with President Kennedy so as to remove completely any reference to tests from the present arrangements? Will he agree that this should be done, with a view to getting on with disarmament at Geneva? If this were done, it would be much better and the Prime Minister would have very large support in the country for that point of view, rather than confusing the two issues.",Mr. Manuel,We must remember that this is exactly what we did for three years.,13/02/1962,0.0006,1,,,
735,"I know all about that, but does not my right hon. Friend appreciate that in the years that the Conservative Party has been in power we have collected four ex-Chancellors, including my right hon. Friend, who, most unhappily, dismally failed in this task? Does not he appreciate that unless and until the Government as a whole and the Prime Minister in particular control and manage policy, expenditure will not be controlled but will continue to control them?",Mr. Hirst,"These difficulties have been discussed and the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a statement about them on 27th February. I am happy to think, however, that, in spite of the difficulties over thees years, we have had the support of my hon. Friend throughout.",08/03/1962,0.0808,1,,,
882,asked the Prime Minister if he will ensure that all British agricultural produce which proves surplus to United Kingdom requirements will be offered as a free gift to any international welfare organisation that can make use of it for famine relief.,Sir R. Glyn,It is natural that opinion in the House and in the country should be disturbed at food being thrown away when many millions of people are under-nourished. A temporary surplus of skim milk is expected this spring if the weather improves. I have considered with my right hon. Friends whether this surplus could be processed and made available to areas of need. To do this it would be necessary to install additional plant which I am told would cost upwards of Â£J million and it would produce dried milk to the value of only a few thousand pounds. The plant would lie idle for the rest of the year.,05/04/1962,0.0095,1,,,
1029,"In the matter of this type of test the argument is often adduced that military advantage will accrue to the allied nations. Does not the right hon. Gentleman agree that this House has never had a clear and logical explanation of this military advantage? Would it not be advisable that we should be informed, and that our minds should be illuminated on that aspect of the subject before the tests are proceeded with?",Mr. Shinwell,"The other day, when I believe the right hon. Gentleman was present, I tried to explain why so much importance was attached to this experiment, knowing its effect on the whole radar and radio-communication system, on which defence depends.",15/05/1962,0.0113,1,,,
1176,"Will the Prime Minister bear in mind that this report by a very  distinguished Committee criticises the very haphazard and inadequate way in which cultural research is financed in this country and points out the serious financial difficulties confronting a number of learned societies, concluding that the situation can be remedied only by some co-ordinating action by the Government? Will he give an assurance that something will be done?",Mr. Fletcher,"This report has been presented. The first thing to do, surely, is to discuss it with its authors.",07/06/1962,0.1734,1,,,
1323,Does not the Prime Minister realise that the official appointment for the first time in British consti tutional history of a Deputy Prime Minister represents a damaging admission on the Prime Minister's part of his own inadequacies?,Mr. Lipton,"This is not an appointment submitted to the Sovereign but is a statement of the organisation of Government. It follows a very high precedent, for it was exactly the arrangement made by my right hon. Friend the Member for Woodford (Sir W. Churchill) when Sir Anthony Eden was appointed Deputy Prime Minister.",19/07/1962,0.0101,1,,,
1470,asked the Prime Minister what further consultations he has had with President Kennedy in regard to the removal of the blockade on Cuba.,Mr. Rankin,"In his exchange of letters with Mr. Khrushchev, President Kennedy made it clear that the lifting of the blockade was conditional on the establishment of adequate arrangements through the United Nations to ensure removal of the offensive weapons already in Cuba and to guard against the introduction of other such weapons. Arrangements for United Nations observation and supervision have not yet been made.",15/11/1962,0.1721,1,,,
1617,"Does not the Prime Minister realise that the good repute of ex-Lord Chancellors, who normally do not sell themselves in the market place, is even mare gravely prejudiced when, as in the latest case, the pension is drawn for a period, then waived, but with an entitlement nevertheless to draw it again? Why cannot Plessey look after its own employees on their retirement?",Mr. Lipton,"The hon. Member has introduced this subject in a rather unnecessarily offensive way, referring to an old colleague of ours who is deeply respected in all parts of the  House. It seems to me not unreasonable that he should draw his pension when he is entitled to draw it and renounce it when he is earning from another source.",11/12/1962,0.0634,1,,,
1764,"Is the Prime Minister aware that were he to examine the present order of Questions he would notice that the combined top-of-the-list appearances of English Ministers with duties similar to those of the Secretary of State for Scotland total 13 against one appearance by the Secretary of State for Scotland? Does the right hon. Gentleman realise that this means that hon. Members who do not represent Scottish constituencies may ask 26 Oral Questions, whereas hon. Members who do represent Scottish constituencies are allowed to ask only two? Does not that savour of discourtesy to Scotland? Will not the Prime Minister see to it in future that hon. Members representing Scottish constituencies may have more opportunities to get to their feet to speak for Scotland?",Mr. Dempsey,"I have, of course, every sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. But the management of Questions  is not a matter for me personally. By discussion in the ordinary way we try to get what best suits the House as a whole. It is difficult to please everybody. But I think that the system we use is the best to protect the interests of the House as a whole.",05/02/1963,0.086,1,,,
1911,asked the Prime Minister whether the public speech of the Lord President of the Council in Glasgow on 16th February on the subject of relations between Great Britain and France represents the policy of Her Majesty's Government.,Mr. Lipton,"Yes, Sir.",26/02/1963,-0.0009,1,,,
2058,asked the Prime Minister if he will take steps to set up a Department of Disarmament with a senior Minister in charge of it.,Mr. G. M. Thomson,"No, Sir. Disarmament is closely linked with the fundamental responsibilities of the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence.  My hon. Friend the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs already has special responsibility, under the Foreign Secretary, for disarmament and devotes a very large part of his time to it.",21/03/1963,0.0163,1,,,
2205,Is it not within the recollection of the Prime Minister that he took special measures to put rockets and V-bombers in a special state of readiness at the time? Does not the Government civil defence policy purport to evacuate 12 million people between the announcement of a state of crisis and the four-minute warning? Has that policy now been quietly dropped as being a complete bluff?,Mr. Zilliacus,"No, Sir.",25/04/1963,-0.0031,1,,,
2352,"asked the Prime Minister whether the Foreign Secretary's public speech at the Canadian Club in Ottawa on 21st May, on the subject of the retention of British nuclear weapons, represented the policy of Her Majesty's Government.",Mr. Zilliacus,I would refer the hon. Member to the reply which I gave to the hon. Member for South Ayrshire (Mr. Emrys Hughes) on 28th May.,30/05/1963,0.0968,1,,,
2499,"asked the Prime Minister (1) whether it is within the terms of reference of the co-ordinating committee on nuclear power, referred to in the Report of the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, to consider the allocation of financial responsibility for research and development on reactors;",Mr. Albu,"I think it would be right for me to maintain the position of successive Governments that details of the work of Cabinet Committees are not normally disclosed. I can, however, assure the hon. Member that the Government will give the most careful consideration to the views expressed by the Select Committee.",11/07/1963,0.2045,1,,,
2646,"Could it in any way hinder progress towards more general disarmament if the Prime Minister were to take some opportunity, for instance, of mentioning the matters referred to in the last part of the Question, such as disengagementâ€”an idea which the right hon. Gentleman once mentioned favourably but which I think he has not referred to for some considerable time? When he is discussing a test ban agreement with President de Gaulle, would the right hon. Gentleman consider drawing the President's attention to the relevant passages in the late Pope's Encyclical, Pacem in Terris?",Mr. Driberg,"All these are important and relevant matters, but, if I have learned anything from my experience in the last few years, it is to proceed by patient negotiation rather than by premature public statements before full consultation.",01/08/1963,0.1855,1,,,
2793,"Will my right hon. Friend accept the appreciation of many hon. Members, myself among them, of this new break-through? Will he convey to the Chancellor our appreciation of his co-operation with my right hon. Friend? Will he also accept my pleasure at the successful result of our assignations and my hope that he will go from strength to strength in the magnificent new break-through which he has so successfully started?",Dame Irene Ward,"The House knows how interested my hon. Friend has always been in these questions. What my colleagues and I were particularly anxious to do was to benefit not only the widow who was ableto go out to work, but the equally deserving widow who stayed behind to look after her children.",10/12/1963,0.0852,1,,,
2940,"asked the Prime Minister whether he is aware that a letter from the hon. Member for Cardiff, South-East, enquiring about the prospects of a double taxation agreement with Ghana in relation to Ghana pensioners, was passed by the Treasury to the Commonwealth Relations Office and later by the Commonwealth Relations Office to the Department of Technical Co-operation; and if he will arrange for better co-ordination in these matters to achieve clearer definition of departmental responsibilities.",Mr. Callaghan,I am sorry about the hon. Member's letter. I agree that it ought to have been passed direct to the Department of Technical Co operation.,21/01/1964,0.4304,1,,,
3087,asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his discussions with Mr. Winston Field; and whether he has accepted his demand for independence for Southern Rhodesia without an agreed revision of the Constitution.,Mr. Stonehouse,"My talks with Mr. Field were confidential, and I have nothing to add to what my right hon. Friend the Commonwealth Secretary told the House on 30th January.",20/02/1964,0.0104,1,,,
3234,Will the Prime Minister tell us what plans he has to prevent any take-overs of private enterprise and increasing monopolisation?,Mr. G. Brown,The right hon. Gentleman asked me whether we would take overâ€”will he repeat his question?,24/03/1964,0.2044,0,,,
3381,"While most earnestly hoping that the Republic of South Africa will finally abandon these political trials, may I ask my right hon. Friend whether he knows whether the United Nations have at any time given any indication of wishing to intervene in matters which are essentially within the jurisdiction of the Republic""â€”sayâ€”""of Ghana""?""",Mr. Longden,"No, Sir; I have no such knowledge.",23/04/1964,-0.0001,1,,,
3528,"In view of the appalling accident figures and the disturbances which have marred recent Bank Holidays, is it not increasing folly to continue this build-up of people and vehicles concentrating on a few week-  ends in the year? Since the Government are already considering the staggering of holidays and discussing this with the interests concerned, would it not be appropriate to discuss at the same time the replacement of Bank Holidays by some modern holiday?",Mrs. Butler,"There is quite a lot in what the hon. Lady says, but we had better have an experiment first. We propose an experiment with August Bank Holiday next year.",02/06/1964,0.1538,1,,,
3675,Can the Prime Minister say what liaison exists between  the Ministry of Labour's Manpower Research Unit and the Statistical Department of the Ministry of Education?,Mr. Merlyn Rees,The hon. Gentleman should put that question down to my right hon. Friend.,02/07/1964,0.0001,1,,,
3822,Has the Prime Minister seen the statement by Mr. Ian Smith yesterday that he wrote to the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations three weeks ago and has not received any reply to that communication? Is that the case?,Mr. Brockway,"The correspondence between Prime Ministers of the Commonwealth is always confidential. Very often a number of very complicated questions are raised in letters and it takes some time to give a considered reply. I have invited Mr. Smith to come here, and I hope that he will be able to accept my invitation.",30/07/1964,0.1736,,,,
3969,"Does the right hon. Gentleman the Secretary of State for the Colonies agree with the Prime Minister's endorsement of this Polaris base, and, if so, did he change his mind before or after entering the Cabinet?",Mr. Biggs-Davison,"My right hon. Friend always, I think, agrees with me. I should start to get worried if he ever agreed with the hon. Gentleman.",01/12/1964,0.0015,,,,
4116,"asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of the damage caused by knock-out and other practices to the reputation of Great Britain as an international art centre, he will advise the appointment of a Royal Commission to review the law relating to public auctions.",Mr. Abse,My right hon. Friend the President of the Board of Trade and the other Ministers concerned are considering whether practices at auction sales can be improved by voluntary regulation and also whether further legislation is necessary and practicable. There have recently been exploratory talks on both matters with the British Antique Dealers Association and the Chartered Institute of Auctioneers and Estate Agents. There is also the important question of the conduct of auctions of Government surplus stores. When these discussions are complete we shall  consider whether there is a case for an independent inquiry.,04/02/1965,0.1756,,,,
4263,asked the Prime Minister what consultations he is having with the leaders of private industry to seek their co-operation in solving the national economic problems.,Mr. Walden,"My colleagues and I intend to continue the policies which have already secured notable co-operation from representatives of private industry, for example, in the reconstruction of the National Economic Development Council, the formation of Economic Development Committees and of Economic Planning Councils.",02/03/1965,0.5769,,,,
4410,"Is the Prime Minister aware that, though he informed me in an earlier Written Answer that no official facilities were provided, the author states in his preface I should like to ask the Prime Minister to give further consideration to the supplementary question asked by the hon. Member for Inverness (Mr. Russell Johnston) so that we can make sure that the allegations made about the Government and the Foreign Secretary of the day are officially and impartially confirmed. If, as my right hon. Friend implies, no official facilities were furnished to Mr. Robertson to write the book, has he any idea how Mr. Robertson managed to get information about decisions taken in the Cabinet? Is my right hon. Friend aware that recently I had an opportunity of reviewing the book and found it full of omissions and inaccuracies? If, as my right hon. Friend implies, no official facilities were furnished to Mr. Robertson to write the book, has he any idea how Mr. Robertson managed to get information about decisions taken in the Cabinet? Is my right hon. Friend aware that recently I had an opportunity of reviewing the book and found it full of omissions and inaccuracies?",Mr. Rowland,"As I go through the book myself, I am becoming more and more interested in some of the information in it certainly, but I confirm that the author has not received any help  from British official sources as to what went on in the Cabinet, or, what seems to be much more relevant, what went on behind the Cabinet's back.",30/03/1965,0.2512,,,,
4557,"Is my right hon. Friend aware that the previous Government, after several years of negotiations with the West German Federal Government, and under pressure from myself and many other members of the previous Opposition, never reached a satisfactory con-  clusion? At the same time, would my right hon. Friend take note of the report about the arrangements between the West German Government and the French Government, and try to get some satisfactory arrangements with the German Government?",Mr. Shinwell,"I am well aware of the achievements, if one can use that word, of the previous Government but in reference to the particular deal that was trumpeted by the Daily Express yesterday, which has so excited the right hon. Gentleman, so far as we can obtain information on this, there is little, and possibly nothing, new in this compared with the orders already placed with the French Government by the German Government when the right hon. Gentleman was in the Cabinet.",06/05/1965,0.1535,,,,
4704,Does the right hon. Gentleman think that this improvement has anything whatever to do with his policies?,Mr. Maudling,"In answer to the Shadow Foreign Secretary, I would point out that the shadow Chancellor, I think he is, sitting next to him, spent a little time at Question Time two weeks ago blaming the Government for the slightly adverse fall in the trade figures between one month and another. Perhaps the right hon. Gentleman can sort it out and brief his right hon. Friend.",27/05/1965,0.1486,,,,
4851,asked the Prime Minister whether he will introduce legislation to return the Elgin Marbles to Athens; and if he will make a statement.,Mr. Hamling,"The Elgin Marbles are vested in the Trustees of the British Museum, and I do not propose to introduce legislation to require the Trustees to return them to Athens.",01/07/1965,0.3523,,,,
4998,"Might I make the observation that I sometimes wish that the right hon. Gentleman would behave like a Prime Minister? On the particular point, while I supported the mission as having an outside chance, the only word with which I can describe the other mission is idiotic"".""",Sir Alec Douglas-Home,"I have tried to take the advice of the right hon. Gentleman. The first advice, of course, marks a welcome change after the previous 12 months. I would hope that he would agree that one of the duties of a Prime Minister is to try to seek peace in this very difficult situation in Vietnam. I might say that it is one of the duties of a Leader of the Opposition to help in that task or to propose alternative means of securing peace, which the right hon. Gentleman has not done. Since he this week condemned the Commonwealth Peace Missionâ€”",22/07/1965,0.2214,,,,
5145,"Is my right hon. Friend aware that on several occasions, for example, the occasions of his important statements of 1st and 3rd November, on Rhodesia, hon. Members wishing to study them had to beg or borrow copies from members of the Press Gallery, and that only one copy in the Library is not really adequate for this purpose?",Mr. Rowland,"I shall consider whether there should be more copies in the Library, but my hon. Friend will recognise that the statements last week had to be prepared right at the last moment, and I was not able to observe the usual courtesy to the Opposition. No member of the Press receives a final copy of what has been said until I have sat down and it has been checked.",16/11/1965,0.0819,,,,
5292,"Would my right hon. Friend agree that, however defensive the acquisition of arms by a country like Saudi Arabia appears to be, the arms would constitute a formidable addition to the striking force of that country and, therefore, create grave anxiety in places like Israel and perhaps even Aden, where they might be used against our own forces, and will inevitably start up a new phase of the arms race in the Middle East?",Mr. Tuck,"I do not disagree with what my hon. Friend has in mind, and certainly in regard to the supply of arms from certain countries to, for example, the U.A.R. and the anxieties felt as between the U.A.R. and Israel, there is every case, if we could reach agreement, for getting some kind of ban on arms. But there are very great difficulties, not least the problem of the nuclear  question, missiles and so on. That is why I say that I do not think that the time has yet been reached when we should be trying to formulate this particular proposition.",07/12/1965,0.1999,,,,
5439,asked the Prime Minister what plans he has to improve the co-ordination between the Ministry of Public Building and Works and the Ministry of Housing and Local Government in the use of building materials.,Mr. Ian Gilmour,"None, Sir, since the present arrangements are satisfactory.",01/02/1966,-0.0002,,,,
5586,"Are we to assume that  integration' means that the reshaping plans are to be abandoned?""",Sir M. Redmayne,"If by ""reshaping plans"" the right hon. Gentleman means  the closure policy, the position on that has been announced several times from this side. There is no abandonment of the policy as enunciated by us—not as enunciated by the previous Government. But by ""integration"" we mean that the system under which the railways have been driven unnecessarily into a position where they cannot pay their way while other sections of the transport industry are very profitable and not brought into the same reckoning, must be ended at the earliest opportunity.",17/02/1966,0.3096,,,,
5733,Would the Prime Minister consider setting up within the Estimates Committee an economic policy committee through which we could cross-examine the intentions of the Treasury?,Mr. Gresham Cooke,"This is a very bad moment to talk about the intentions of the Treasury when we have not yet heard the Budget statement. But I should have thought that the House has abundant opportunities to debate economic policies, and the view expressed by many hon. Members on both sides of the House is that there are not corresponding facilities in other fields of national and, indeed, international policy.",03/05/1966,0.1795,,,,
5880,"Since N.A.T.O. came into being to safeguard Western Europe against a Stalinist expansionist policy, and since that policy has been dropped, ought not N.A.T.O. to be reconsidered entirely.",Sir C. Osborne,The hon. Member is raising some very wide issues which have been debated many times and which have required full debate. There is a very serious situation going on in N.A.T.O. Of course we have said that we must take advantage of the fact which the hon. Member mentioned to modernise those aspects of N.A.T.O. which need modernisation and on which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence has made a number of proposals over the past year.,19/05/1966,0.0225,,,,
6027,"I will tell the Prime Minister perfectly clearly why I did not support the Government in the Lobby. I supported them by my voice here, as he  himself has done on many occasions in the past when he supported the Government of the day but did not go with the Opposition into the Lobby.",Mr. Heath,"The right hon. Gentleman will recall that on that same day he voted against the Government on Rhodesia policy, and when hon. Members were asked to stand up and be counted on the oil sanctions he sat in his place and did not vote. Is he aware that on this, as on other things, we might have had action and not words in support of the Government?",23/06/1966,0.2066,,,,
6174,"The right hon. Gentleman has twice now called in aid the position of the Co-Chairmanship. Of course, that is important, but have the Russians imposed any such restrictions from their side?",Sir Alec Douglas-Home,"No, Sir. I have said many times at Question Time, and I said it in the recent debate, that the fact that the Russians have supplied arms is not a reason why we should. I think that it is right, and it is the view of the Government, that in this respect we should take a more austere and responsible view of our position as Co-Chairman than the Russians do, and, apparently, than the right hon. Gentleman did when he was concerned.",14/07/1966,0.183,,,,
6321,"Is the Prime Minister aware that I have been rereading the speech with great interest? He will no doubt recall that, in that speech, he referred to the moaning Minnies and wet editorials""",Mr. Bruce-Gardyne,"I am glad that the hon. Gentleman read the speech, even if he did not use the one in the Library. The wet editorial which I had in mind was one in the Observer the Sunday before I made the speech, which suggested that the Â£ was over-valued and ought to be devalued. I thought that this was particularly wet and particularly irrelevant. I thought that, since we have increased our exports to the most competitive market of allâ€”the United Statesâ€”by 40 per cent. in the last 18 months, the term wet"" was a very kind appellation to apply to that editorial.""",04/08/1966,0.2255,,,,
6468,"In making preparations for an Asian visit, would my right hon. Friend give consideration to the possibilities of linking British aid to developing countries with under-used resources in this country, such for instance as the capacity at Bathgate where there is 9 per cent. unemployment?",Mr. Dalyell,"That is a bit remote from the visit. As my hon. Friend knows, I had to decline, with regret, because of the possibility of an early recall of the House, an invitation to visit India. On the question my hon. Friend raises, this is very much our policy so far as possible. Indeed, as soon as the Bathgate position became clear, I asked whether in the aid we are giving to Zambia in the matter of trucks we could use Bathgate's capacity. Unfortunately, Bathgate did not produce the kind of trucks needed in Zambia.",01/11/1966,0.1958,,,,
6615,asked the Prime Minister if he will now amend the six principles named by him on the basis of a possible settlement of the Rhodesian question so as to make the granting of majority rule to the peoples of that Colony a condition precedent to a settlement.,Mr. Elystan Morgan,Our position on majority rule is made clear in the communiquÃ© issued after the recent meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.,17/11/1966,0.1378,,,,
6762,asked the Prime Minister what is his practice on transferring Questions.,Sir C. Osborne,"The traditional practice, Sir.",08/12/1966,0.0235,,,,
6909,The Prime Minister may go on trying to deceive the rest of the world about whatâ€” All he  is doing is succeeding in deceiving himself. Will the Prime Minister now address himself to the question and give the House a serious answer?,Mr. Heath,"I do not deceive myself about the right hon. Gentleman's vote.  I will reply to the right hon. Gentleman's preamble first and then reply to his question. I do not deceive myself about the right hon. Gentleman's vote, which is on the record in this House, and which he could have avoided by an honest Amendment to our Motion.",02/02/1967,0.0815,,,,
7056,"Is my right hon. Friend aware that I am very grateful for the favourable commendation from the right hon. Gentleman the Member for Streatham (Mr. Sandys), but in the Government's present difficulties, which cannot be concealed, does he not think it advisable for members of the Cabinet to be careful about the company that they keep?",Mr. Shinwell,"In view of the courtesies between the two right hon. Members, which I must say are over my head, I would certainly not feel that any difficulty has arisen from the presence of my right hon. Friend at that meeting, despite the fact that I understand that at least one right hon. Gentleman present took advantage of the occasion to make  a little party capital, even though I thought that it was a non-party occasion.",23/02/1967,0.1633,,,,
7203,"Would not my right hon. Friend agree that while it is right and proper that we should encourage the United Nations Mission to visit Aden and do its work there, the threat of murder and riot which has been issued recently is sufficient for us to think again about sending children there during that period?",Mr. Leadbitter,"That is a separate question, which was fully dealt with by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence yesterday. Much as we deplore the statement made by one of the leaders of F.L.O.S.Y., reported in the Press this morning, I do not think that that in itself adds anything more to the very fearsome and deplorable record of terrorism there is in Aden, which was taken fully into account in all the answers my right hon. Friend gave yesterday afternoon.",14/03/1967,0.083,,,,
7350,"Was not the Secretary of State's speech very misleading in that he quoted figures of overseas assets of the United Kingdom of Â£16,000 millionâ€”incidentally, mostly built up by private enterpriseâ€”but neglected to mention the fact that there were nearly Â£14,000 million liabilities?",Sir C. Taylor,"No, Sir. My right hon. Friend did not say anything so misleading. He said: Britain's overseas assets total nearly 40,000 million dollars and gross assets exceed gross liabilities by more than 5,000 million dollars. If the hon. Gentleman will do the simple process of subtracting and dividing by 2Â·8, he will find that this gives the same figure as he has reached himself in sterling.",11/04/1967,0.4496,,,,
7497,"Will my right hon. Friend take into account the present fiscal system, which, in some respects, conflicts with our social security system in that the highest tax allowances give benefits in respect of, for example, housing and educationâ€”benefits which are available to the richest people?",Mr. Whitaker,"I am well aware of that argument. It was one of the points made by a number of hon. Members in the debate. However, I cannot at this stage prejudge the Government's announcement on this later in the summer.",04/05/1967,-0.0025,,,,
7644,asked the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his recent talks with General de Gaulle.,Mr. Eldon Griffiths,"With permission, I will answer Questions Q8, Q9 and Q11 at the end of Question Time.",20/06/1967,-0.0018,,,,
7791,"Is it not a fact that Lord Alport will return at the weekend, and, if it be so, may we hope for a statement from the Government next week?",Mr. King,I think that his present plans involve a return either at the weekend or early next week.

As my hon. Friend knows, in addition to the talks my right hon. Friend had with the French President and his Government in January, I had very full discussions with the French President in June. Our discussions must continue to be with the Six.",07/11/1967,0.1327,,,,
8085,"Is my right hon. Friend aware that, whatever political objections may be coming from France, within France the technologists and scientists are extremely interested in collaboration? Will he particularly pursue the question of Capenhurst and the high temperature reactor?",Dr. Owen,"I am aware that the scientists and technologists in France are extremely anxious to co-operate with us in the Capenhurst-Piemelatte kind of link, but also, as I said at the Guildhall, there is the need, on a wider European basis, to make Europe independent of supply from across the seas of enriched uranium 235 and other nuclear material.",30/11/1967,0.1597,,,,
8232,"Is the Prime Minister aware that many of his hon. Friends feel that a central authoritative source of information would greatly assist with Press relations and would enable the Government to, for example, mount a buy British campaign to back up devaluation?",Mr. Ford,"I think that the existing arrangements whereby Government decisions are notified to this House â€”and by other appropriate and well tried channelsâ€”are perfectly adequate in this matter. I am aware that former Governments have had Ministers specially charged with this duty, but experience of that has shown that there are better ways of communicating decisions reached by the Cabinet.",19/12/1967,0.1056,,,,
8379,"While he is in Washington, will the Prime Minister remind not only President Johnson but the people of the United States of the text of the resolution carried at the Labour Party conference, which asked not only for the stopping of bombing but for our dissociation from the American aggression in Vietnam? Why does the Prime Minister, by way of a change, not try a nice long visit to Chairman Mao Tse Tung whose aims in South-East Asia the Government are doing so much to help? Why does the Prime Minister, by way of a change, not try a nice long visit to Chairman Mao Tse Tung whose aims in South-East Asia the Government are doing so much to help? Will the Prime Minister make clear that there can be no improvement in Anglo-Soviet relations so long as the Soviet Union persists in fomenting trouble in the Middle East by training and arming Egypt for a renewal of the war against Israel?",Mrs. Anne Kerr,"In my talks in Moscow we discussed Middle East questions, including the Suez Canal question, at great length. Their position is, of course, basically different from ours, but both sides have supported the resolution put forward in the Security Council by the British Government.",06/02/1968,0.1531,,,,

8673,asked the Prime Minister whether he has given consideration to the decision of the House of  Lords in Conway v. Rimmer and another; and whether instructions have been issued to Government Departments regarding claims to Crown privilege in the light of it.,Sir D. Walker-Smith,Careful consideration is being given to the implications of this decision. No fresh instructions have yet been issued to Government Departments regarding claims to Crown privilege but this will be done as soon as possible. Should any questions of claiming privilege arise before fresh instructions are issued it will be dealt with on its merits in the light of the House of Lords decision.,26/03/1968,0.3843,,,,
8820,"In trying to improve the public relations and Press relations of the Government and Government Departments, will my right hon. Friend look at the possibility of employing more working journalists in the information services and fewer public relations officers who come from differing and non-journalist backgrounds?",Dr. Gray,"I cannot immediately think of many, or any, such public relations officers, though I may be wrong. Certainly, those most closely associated with me were working journalists with great experience of the Press.",11/04/1968,0.4288,,,,
8967,"Would not the Prime Minister agree that the recent statement by Smith that there can be no majority  rule in Rhodesia for a hundred years makes a mockery of any proposals brought back from Rhodesia by the right hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home)? In view of the continued fighting in Rhodesia, is not even the illegal rÃ©gime's law and order now breaking down?",Mr. Winnick,"I have already commented in this House on the statement made by Mr. Smith in the Sunday Telegraph. It suggests, if we are to take those words at their face value, that he rejects the whole concept of the six principles on which not only Her Majesty's Government but the right hon. Member for Kinross and West Perthshire (Sir Alec Douglas-Home) was insisting in his visit.",16/05/1968,0.3724,,,,
9114,"In view of the considerable technological advances and the amount of foreign currency earned by the industry, would my right hon. Friend consider making the ship-repair industry eligible for the Award?",Dr. Dunwoody,"As I said, it was agreed with industry at the beginning of the scheme, which has now been running for more than two years, that the whole question of eligibility and coverage should be reviewed at the end of five years' working. No doubt that would provide an appropriate time for considering my hon. Friend's question.",13/06/1968,0.2593,,,,

Friend is concerned with the effect of tourism on the balance of payments he will be glad to know that the number of foreign visitors arriving in the United Kingdom in the first four months of 1968 was 18 per cent. higher than in the corresponding period of 1967. As to a Department of Tourism, my view is still as I expressed it in reply to a Question by my right hon.

9555,"Can my right hon. Friend reassure the House that it will be no part of the present negotiations that the personnel of such a Royal Commission will be subject to the approval of Mr. Smith, and that it would be possible for Her Majesty to appoint Mr. Kaunda as president of it without having any difficulty?",Mr. Pavitt,"In the ""Fearless"" proposals we made it clear that the appointment would be ours. It would, of course, be subject to consultation with the Rhodesian régime. I do not know whether my right hon. Friend in Salisbury will be taking this matter further, but I can imagine President Kaunda himself having some reservations about the proposal my hon.

Friend the Member for Banbury (Mr. Marten)?",Sir D. Walker-Smith,"The absence of such a conference has not prevented us from raising the matter in a number of areas and places with Common Market countries. But since I have no plans to set up such a conference, as I said in answer to the original Question, it is obviously a little premature to start answering the right hon. Gentleman's question about what will be on the agenda of such a conference.",28/11/1968,0.3488,,,,
9849,"Surely the Prime Minister would agree that the longer the proposals lie on the table without being taken up, the less likelihood there is that they will be accepted. Rather than this country suffering the humiliation of always appearing to be running after Mr. Smith to see what might please him, should not we indicate that they will lie on the table for weeks, not months?",Mr. Thorpe,"There is no suggestion of running after Mr. Smith to see what might please him. One of the arguments which had to be used at the conference and which has been used in this House was that, while it might be tempting to say, ""Let things drag on and on"", there are considerable dangers affecting not only African employment but perhaps more dangerous developments there. Certainly there is a danger of a strong move towards apartheid. This is why we feel it right to leave the proposals on the table so that those presently in authority there or anyone who may wish to put pressure on them will have something to turn to as an alternative to what I believe to be the very dangerous developments which will happen if they are not taken up.",21/01/1969,0.3622,,,,

Osborne,"I am not going to say in which of these two operations I have met with the more resistance. The hon. Gentleman, who made helpful comments on behalf of all of us in this House when out there, will know that we have indeed shown tremendous patience and tenacity in trying to get an honourable agreement which we could justify in this House and in Rhodesia as well. I do not think that it could be laid to the charge of the Government if, after all we have done—leaving the ""Fearless"" terms on the table in the face of considerable Commonwealth pres-  sure to withdraw them—there is no agreement. We are still prepared to consider alternative proposals about a second safeguard if that is the sticking point, provided that they are equally effective to what we have proposed.",17/04/1969,0.2468,,,,

10731,"In that case, if there was a Franco-British deterrent within the nuclear planning group within N.A.T.O. there could be no objection?",Mr. Heath,"The right hon. Gentleman has on a number of occasions, both in this country and abroad, proposed a Franco-British deterrent. So far as that is concerned, there would be no derogation from the authority of N.A.T.O.,  because it would be two existing nuclear Powers combining. There may be many arguments against that, and in my view this is a matter on which we are certainly not prepared to propose anything to the French Government. That is a very different thing, as his own arguments suggest, from a European deterrent with other people deciding who pulls the trigger.",17/07/1969,0.2123,,,,

Gentleman's broadcastâ€”very slightly. I could do much better if he were here, but I do not think that I should in his absence. It is very unusual that he is absent, and I am sorry that he is not here. But he must take responsibility for that forecast. I do not think that it is for me to give another one, but I do not accept that the  timetable need be anything like as long as he said.",04/12/1969,0.0025,,,,

Friend will be aware of the suggestion that other European countries have perhaps been more enthusiastic for a European security conference than Great Britain and the United States. Will he say whether he had any discussions on this point with the President of the United States, and whether either of them has become a little more enthusiastic for the European conference, as has been suggested was the case?",Mr. Hugh Jenkins,"We discussed this very fully. Her Majesty's Government's view is that, as I said in the communiquÃ© at the end of Mr. Kosygin's visit in 1967, a conference would be useful if it is well prepared and covers all relevant questions affecting European security. It should not be a matter just for shouting slogans at one another. All the slogans are fairly familiar. It should deal with real questions. We do not feel that the present proposed agenda deals adequately with these matters. I stressed in Washington, as I have in this House, the need for us to make a positive response and not to be on the defensive about it, but to say that we will welcome this security conference provided it has an agenda dealing with all relevant aspects of European security.",03/02/1970,0.3637,,,,

V. Harvey,"I know that the hon. Gentleman is putting forward this seriously, unlike some other suggestions which have been made. I have had close relationships with the Prime Minister of Malta when he has visited this country, not only for the Commonwealth Prime Ministers' conference. Certainly I will consider what the hon.

Without accepting the obviously circumstantial language in which those reports  have been reported, will the Prime Minister repeat this warning to the country?",Mr. Heath,"As for reading the article which the right hon.

It is customary in Governments of both parties that members of the Cabinet should hold party office. There is nothing unusual about that.

I have never denied that. I was President of the Board of Trade when it was established. The question that now arises is whether the work that is required for the consumer should be done by a Government-sponsored body. We have come to the conclusion that there are now other organisations.  I should have thought that the hon.

Would he, therefore, consider, as his quickest and best single contribution to halting the rise in food prices, cutting at a stroke the Minister of Agriculture?",Mr. John D. Grant,"As my right hon.

Gentleman tell us whether President Pompidou held a different view at the meeting at Chequers last weekend?",Mr. Healey,"On the latter point, the view of both of us remains the same, that the time is not ripe to discuss these matters. My views are well known. At the Elysee we also agreed, as the right hon. Gentleman said, that the time was not ripe for dealing with this.

14994,"The Prime Minister will recall on that occasion making an optimistic and confident economic projection. How would he now modify it in view of two developments last week: first, the official acknowledgment that the handsome surplus on the balance of payments account has now disappeared and, secondly, the barish picture offered by the National Institute?",Mr. Duffy,"The Institute was the first to acknowledge the difficulty of making forecasts. As far as the balance  of payments forecasts in the past are concerned the institute itself acknowledged that its experience has been particularly ""unhappy"", to use its own word.",19/12/1972,0.3069,,,,
15141,"Will my right hon. Friend confirm that one of the most important items in the President's anti-inflation policy is the production of more food at home, and will my right hon. Friend follow that by encouraging British agriculture to grow more food at home?",Mr. John Wells,"This was one of the first actions of the present administration when we had a special price review in the autumn of 1970. From that time onwards expansion has been encouraged in British agriculture, and the British farmer has responded to that encouragement.",13/02/1973,0.3097,,,,
15288,"Has not there been an unduly narrow interpretation of the speech? Is my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister aware of the very close relationship between the Secretary of State and the trade union movement in Northern Ireland? Far from bashing trade unionism, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has readily paid tribute to the high sense of responsibility of trade unionists.",Mr. Stratton Mills,"My hon. Friend is quite right.

Gentleman to the answer which I gave to his supplementary question on 12th April . As I said then, I am considering this matter generally, but the position of appointees to public bodies is different from that of members of the Civil Service, and this must be taken into account.",03/05/1973,0.2952,,,,
15729,"Bearing in mind the criticisms made earlier this year, when the Government intervened to help the building society movement, is it not heartening that funds are now flowing into the the societies and the general base rate is going down?",Mr. Tapsell,It is heartening that funds should be flowing into the building societies. I am not aware that any announcement has yet been made by them but consideration must surely now be given by the building societies to the question whether they can reduce their rate. This was obviously the point of the bridging subsidy.,14/06/1973,0.299,,,,
15876,Is there any way whereby the Government and the TUC can get together to work out a formula that will deal with the situation which sometimes arises at works meetings when people are honestly trying to work out disputes but disruptive elements infiltrate as though they were bona fide employees with a view to upsetting the whole thing?,Sir Harmar Nicholls,There may be difficulties of a particular kind such as my hon. Friend mentions. I think I know the case to which he refers.

16317,"When will the Prime Minister acknowledge that whilst, as everyone now knows, the three-day week was a gross overkill measure against the overtime ban, in the event of a miners' strike no amount of three-day weeks or two-and-a-half-day weeks will save him from having to settle with the miners? When will he stop playing electoral politics with the nation's livelihood?",Mr. Meacher,"The published figures show absolutely that the Government were right to take the measures when they did. It was because we did so that a week ago, after consulting the TUC and the CBI, we were in a position to move to a five-day week on 80 per cent. of electricity power. The nation could have done that in safety. There is only one reason why we were unable to do it, and that the House knows.",29/01/1974,0.3282,,,,

Agreement was given some time ago, before the present Government came to office. This is a matter that we have considered, but after the exchanges we have had, I believe that we cannot go back on the decision taken by the right hon. Gentleman.",28/03/1974,0.1667,,,,
16611,"With reference to the Prime Minister's absurd suggestion in that speech that certain sections of the Press were out to make Parliament unworkable, why is it that he still cannot realise that the function of the journalist and the television man is limited to getting news and getting it into newspapers and on to television? Does not the Prime Minister realise that those are not my words but are a quotation from his secretary, Mrs. Williams, in her description of his own attitude to the Press?",Mr. Lamont,"Yes, Sir. Concerning what I said in the House, the Press would fail in these endeavours if it were not for the fact that certain Members of the Opposition had aided it in what it was trying to do.

If the Prime Minister is not satisfied with either the Press Council or the long period which the Royal Commission on the Press may take to report, I repeat the invitation for him, with the benefit of privilege, to justify his statements to this House.",Mr. Heath,"It does not need the benefit of privilege. The right hon. Gentleman, shortly after the February election, gave the House the benefit of a debate on the Press on a Supply Day when these matters were to some extent raised.

Friend the Member for Bolsover (Mr. Skinner) of these men as political prisoners?,Mr. Peyton,"I take the view that these were defendants who were prosecuted in accordance with the law as it stood and sentenced in accordance with the law as it stood. To that extent I agree with the right hon. Gentleman. This is a matter for legislation in which the whole House has authority, and the whole House must consider whether the use of conspiracy charges in such cases is not totally unacceptable and wrong.",14/01/1975,0.0073,,,,
17199,"When the renegotiations are complete, does the Prime Minister intend both to defend them and to attack them?",Mr. Cormack,"When the negotiations are complete, if we find that the termsâ€”replacing the utterly humiliating and grovelling terms negotiated by the Conservative Government on the basis of full Cabinet collective responsibilityâ€”are the right terms, we shall commend them  to Parliament.

Friend should go to the Borders, Brighton or anywhere else, would he care to explain to the electorate how it was that in the election manifesto of the Labour Party in October last year we said that we would not introduce any forms of legislation to deal with incomes?

Would he also explain to the electorate whether during the election campaign my hon. Friends and his hon. Friends in the Government were knaves or fools?",Mr. Heffer,"My hon. Friend also will be awaiting the publication of the White Paper with anxiety. With his knowledge of the manifestoâ€”and I think my knowledge is equal to hisâ€”he will remember that the important and key section of the manifesto said that the Government's highest priority would be the attack on inflation.  I think my hon. Friend was referring to the October manifesto. Even with his highly developed critical faculties, I think that he will feel that what we are proposing is of the highest relevance to that.

Gentleman given any consideration to the more direct representation on NEDC of such firms?",Mr. McCrindle,"This is a matter for the NEDC as a whole, and not for the Government. The CBI is represented, and if the hon. Member were ever to receive a report, as I have done many times, of one of the quarterly meetings of the CBIâ€”the full-dress conference of its membershipâ€”he would find that small firms in all parts of the country were well represented there. I have never found the CBI to be in any way backward in expressing the anxieties of small firms, just as much as it expresses the anxieties of big firms. In some cases it gives more expression to the anxieties of the small firms than it does to those of the large firms.",04/11/1975,0.1875,,,,

By this time we had hoped to receive some comments from the Opposition about the success of the Government's policy and the acceptance by the whole population of our proposals on inflation, which the Opposition did not dare vote against or for. We had hoped that we would receive some compliments from them about the fact that the balance of payments last year showed a deficit of less than half what it was the previous year, and very much less than it was in the Opposition's last year of office, before the rise in oil prices began to hit Britain.",20/01/1976,0.2954,,,,

If he could raise those matters it would be a humanitarian gesture that would be very much appreciated.",Mr. Thorpe,"I am aware of that. Mr. Gromyko, as well as Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Kosygin, knows that I have raised these matters many times.

I was about to say that it is based on the need to provide the necessary social infrastructure upon which our industrial system can depend. Because of that, I think it would be foolish to talk about large-scale cuts in public expenditure. What is much more important is that we should increase the rate of gross domestic production so that we can finance these needs out of the increase.",06/05/1976,0.0627,,,,

As regards the future, the hon. Member for Derbyshire, South-East (Mr. Rost) and I share a feeling about this matter. It is one which has gone to the Select Committee on Procedure.

Is he aware that the President of the United States is implementing the programme of the American trade union movement with whose support he was elected and is spending $25,000 million to create 1,100,000 new jobs? In his forthcoming discussions with the President, will my right hon. Friend agree that Great Britain should have a similar policy and should abandon the policy of not spending more public money to save jobs but rather of allowing unemployment to remain at its present high level?",Mr. John Mendelson,"Such a policy will be appropriate when the Government secure, as they intend, a level of inflation and a balance of payments surplus that are comparable to those of the United States.

Friend next meets the Chairman of the Central Electricity Generating Board, will he discuss with him the fact that both he and the Secretary of State for Energy have now clearly decided what ""good girls"" they are and in the matter of Drax B have agreed on the price? In those circumstances, will he assure the House that the order for Drax B, on which thousands of jobs in my constituency and in Scotland depend, will be brought forward with the minimum of delay?",Mr. Thomas,"I can give my hon. Friend an assurance that the order for the Drax B power station will be made with the minimum of delay. I do not wish to quantify that, but discussions are proceeding urgentlyâ€”indeed, at almost daily intervals. We are well aware of the circumstances and my hon. Friend has represented his case fully. We shall have to see how we can bring this to a conclusion. There are certain conclusions that the Government would like to achieve that would improve the health of the industry, but, whatever the result of those conclusions, Drax B will have to be ordered.",12/05/1977,0.1599,,,,

In view of the urgency of the situation, will he give a firm undertaking that the Government will reach a decision on this much-prevaricated matter before the impending redundancies at C. A.

The GEC management, the National Enterprise Board, the CPRS and the Government all take the view that the industry should be restructured if it is to have a long-term future. My hon. Friend is vehemently opposed to that and is supporting the workers of Parsons and the unions involved. However, that does not alter the nature of the argument and the Government must look at the long-term interests. We cannot enforce such a restructuring. I am glad that it is going ahead on the boiler-making side, but my hon. Friend has not been able to persuade his constituents in Parsonsâ€”if he has triedâ€”that a similar restructuring of the turbo-generator side would be in their interests.

I reiterate how pleased I am that the broadcast undertaken on behalf of the Labour Party last week has aroused such public interest, and, I am glad to say, some controversy, too, because it is as well that our attitudes should be clearly out in the open and that we should understand where we are.

Does he think that Select Committees are a waste of time?",Mr. Moonman,"I do not think that Select Committees are a waste of time. They can do a very useful job, provided that the working assumptions as to the responsibilities of Select Committees and the Government are observed. The general understanding is that Ministers should always observe them and should be as helpful as possible to Select Committees in trying to satisfy their requests for information. It is well known to both sides that there are difficulties from time to time about this in matters of commercial interest. This has arisen because of a recent dispute; I shall not pronounce on that now.

Gentleman for asking me about that. I am sorry if my remarks on Saturday led to any confusion. They were intended to be a clarification on a firm basis. It is not the first time that that sort of thing has gone adrift.

I wish the House to know exactly what was in my mind when I went a little further. As an old negotiator I know that sometimesâ€” Hold it. We are talking about serious matters. I know that another 0Â·1 per cent. or 0Â·2 per cent. may bring a settlement that otherwise would not be achieved. A margin is needed at the negotiating edge. That is what I meant.

Will the Prime Minister change her policy to that of conciliation, and start by dropping the Employment Bill?",Mr. Allan Roberts,"One of the outstanding things in the last few weeks of the steel strike has been the way that ordinary members of trade unions have kept on at their jobs and not come out in support of the main steel strike.

Gentleman says that he does not wish to use these matters party politically. That is the record. May I point out that one of the cases that were prominent in the House last weekâ€”that of Matthew Mulhallâ€”was also mentioned again on Friday and it was pointed out that Matthew had a leaking heart valve and that his consultant advised his parents that it would be,19/01/1988,0.074,,,,

Members on both sides of the House? One of the Committee's recommendations was that a committee should be established to assist and advise the Home Secretary in cases of appeal. I should like my right hon. Friend to consider whether that is right. It is important to note that the House has not yet had a chance to discuss the recommendation. Will my right hon. Friend do something about that?",Sir John Farr,"My answer to my hon. Friend has to be in the negative, because the Government's response to that recommendation was set out in the Government reply to the sixth report from the Home Affairs Select Committee, Session 1981â€“82. The reply concluded that, as a matter of principle, priority should be given to improving and enhancing the part played by the courts in considering alleged miscarriages of justice.

Is it not obvious that the further increase in interest rates came because the Government have completely lost control of credit?  Having completely lost control of credit, the Prime Minister is making British industry pay the price, as usual. Why does she always do that? Is it any wonder, given those policies, that British industry has lost 20 per cent. of the international market and 30 per cent. of the British market? Why does the Prime Minister not give our producers a chance for a change?",Mr. Kinnock,"Short-term interest rates are the essential instrument of monetary policy. If the right hon. Gentleman has no such instruments to control it, how does he ever expect to be able to keep inflation down? But then, of course, he never did. With regard to industry, may I make it absolutely clear that a 1 per cent. increase in wages costs industry four times as much as a 1 per cent. increase in interest rates.

This morning's trade figures show that since December our exports rose by 11 per cent. over last year's figure.

Gentleman for referring to that action by Dudley Labour council, which was not under an obligation to collect that sum from the deceased person's estate.  The relevant regulations provide only that sums owing may be recovered in the administration of the person's estate and from his executor or administrator. The Department of the Environment has been advising authorities that if a person dies shortly after 1 April they should consider writing off any outstanding amount.

We have sought to encourage savings by abolishing the investment income surcharge and by introducing tax-exempt special savings accounts. It is the Labour party which wants to increase  tax by extending national insurance. Its plans would hit more than 1 million people, three quarters of whom pay tax at the basic rate.

They will welcome the fact that the Gas Consumers Council represents gas consumers' interests and deals with complaints. I much prefer profits to losses, provided that there is a good service for customers, and that the price, which the regulator seeks to determine, is right.

Gentleman is right about the need to take all the necessary public health measures. The reality is that we have always taken the action that was seen to be necessary and the advice that has been offered. In 1989, we took action that went beyond the advice that we had received. I have had an opportunity to look at the proposals that the Opposition made this morning. They are a mixture of motherhood and action that is already being taken, and they largely miss many of the matters that need to be dealt with.  The plan for a separate food agency would mean that matters such as this would no longer be represented round the Cabinet table but would be represented in an agency. The chief medical officer already has the support that he has asked for to carry out his duties.

I suppose that Labour's recent proposals for curfews will be adopted for a short while by some Labour Members, but will be ditched after a decent interval.

The OECD report published today shows how inaccurate he is. It says that prospects for achieving sustained output, growth and low inflation are the best for 30 years. The OECD now expects the UK's growth rate next yearâ€”and the year after nextâ€”to be the highest in the group of industrial nations, easily outstripping Japan, Germany, France and the United States. It also forecasts falling unemployment on the back of that. There is no doubt that it is a glowing report.

Those deaths were not televised; they took place in Africa, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in a conflict that has claimed almost 4 million lives, making it the deadliest war since world war two. Will the Prime Minister use his influence to use the upcoming G8 meeting to increase the numbers of UN observers and peacekeepers? Will he ensure that just because those deaths were not televised, the victims will not be forgotten?",Ms Oona King,"My hon. Friend makes an entirely justified point. I assure her that we are working closely with the UN and other troop-contributing countries to ensure the deployment of what was supposed to be almost 9,000 UN peacekeepers. They were mandated by the UN last December and we are trying to insert them into the situation there. Once again, we exhort all parties to abide by UN Security Council resolution 1468, which condemns violations of human rights and international humanitarian law and calls on all parties to cease their hostilities immediately.

Friend that we hope very much that the President will again give his strong support to the middle east peace process, and to the need to develop a process that will allow us, ultimately, to have an Israeli state that is confident of its security and an independent, viable Palestinian state. That is what we will work towards. Obviously, any measure being taken at the moment that inhibits those  developments is not good for the long-term future of that process. In the end, however, the process in the middle east will not succeed until there is the clearest possible security plan that allows us to make sure that the terrorism also stops, so that we can create the confidence in which Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side.",19/11/2003,0.2479,,,,

The right hon. and learned Gentleman says that he does not want to prejudge the inquiry, but that is precisely what the chairman of the Conservative party has done. I therefore ask him again either to substantiate the claim that the Government leaked the document or to withdraw it, because he is getting rather a reputation for making such allegations when there is no substance to them.",28/01/2004,0.3019,,,,
44541,"My constituent, Miss Caroline Cocker, wants to buy a home of her own. She has been to see her building society mortgage adviser, who told her that because of her student debt of Â£12,000, the building society cannot lend her enough. The Minister for Lifelong Learning, Further and Higher Education recently admitted that top-up fees are likely to push student debt up to some Â£20,000. What does the Prime Minister think that that will do to the housing market?",Mr. David Rendel,"Let us first look at the issue of debt. It is correct that students can already take out a Â£12,000 maintenance loan. Under our proposals, they will be charged and will pay back, once they graduate, up to Â£3,000 a year for a three-year course, so that is another Â£9,000. But this is not a debt like an ordinary mortgage debt. Nothing is to be paid back until people  have the means to pay, and it is linked to their ability to pay and carries no real rate of interest. That is surely better than doing what the hon. Gentleman is suggesting, which is to raise the top rate of tax to 50 per cent., or what the Conservative party would do, which is to cut the number of students going to university.",10/03/2004,0.0709,,,,
44688,"The Prime Minister has just admitted that the state of our education is a scandal, but he has been in office for seven years. He has not answered a single one of the questions that I have put to him today. The answer to the last question that I asked about his earned autonomy initiative was that not a single school has been granted earned autonomyâ€”not one! Not a single school has been allowed the freedom that the Prime Minister promised the country at the last election. When parents hear him talking today about school freedom, expanding popular schools and giving parents more choice, all of which we have long called for and supported, will they not recognise that we must judge the Prime Minister not by what he says, but by what he does, and that what he does is never what he says?",Mr. Howard,"First, let me repeat that all the specialist schools have greater autonomy and freedom, which I pointed out to the right hon. and learned Gentleman a short time ago. Since we are talking about scandals in the education system, yes, I think that every single child who is deprived of a decent education in this country represents a loss and social injustice to that child and the country. Let us look at what we have achieved. In seven years, the number of failing schools has halved and the number of state schools getting over 70 per cent. good GCSEs has doubled. The city academies are a great innovation in our system, as are the specialist schools. We have put up the results in primary schools, at GCSE and for A-levels.",07/07/2004,0.2884,,,,

However, there will also be bewilderment, and indeed a degree of shame, that men with such fine service should have been placed in such a position on such flimsy evidence. Can the Prime Minister imagine what it is like to be a young soldier in Basra, having to look ahead for bombers and snipers and behind for the Attorney-General?",Derek Conway,"That last point is wrong and unfair. I am delighted that the soldiers were acquitted, and I hope that the lessons will be learned by the prosecuting authorities. As the hon.

Why have the Government neutered the Bill that would bring that about in law?",Mr. Cameron,"We do not neuter any proposalsâ€” We do not.

I am tempted to ask him whether he will bring the boys back home by Christmasâ€”but even with his powers, I do not think that the English cricket team would agree to that. On a more serious note, last Thursday there was a large meeting of the all-party cancer group in the Queen Elizabeth hall, which was well attended. At that meeting, the Secretary of State for Health made everybody feel good about cancer treatments in this country for the future and announced a new cancer strategy, which was welcomed by patient groups, charities and clinicians. That is important. Does my right hon. Friend agree that giving information to patients, from early diagnosis right through to palliative care, empowers them and gives them the choice that we desire them to have?",Dr. Gibson,"My hon. Friend is right to emphasise the importance of keeping patients fully informed, especially in the very difficult circumstances when they are diagnosed with cancer. He is right to point out that, over the past few years, there has been enormous progress. Not only are we spending about Â£600 million more, but there are 1,500 more consultant posts. Most importantly, almost 100 per cent. of people are now seen within two weeks by a consultant when they are suspected of having cancerâ€”up from two thirds a few years back. As a result of the cancer strategy, which, as my hon. Friend indicates, we are now taking forward, about 50,000 lives have been savedâ€”as a result of the improvements in treatment.

After last weekâ€™s Budget, does he accept that those earning less than Â£18,500 a year who are not eligible for tax credits will have to pay an increase in income tax? How fair is that?",Sir Menzies Campbell,"Again, if I could ask the right hon. and learned Gentleman to look at the matter in the round, over the past 10 years those families have seen their income rise in percentage terms by more than the top people.  The Tories may shout, but they opposed every one of the measures to reduce poverty in our country. As a result of the investment in tax credits, families with children, in particular, have benefited enormously over the past few years. I agree with the right hon. and learned Gentleman that we have to do even more. That is why the measures announced by the Chancellor will actually take an additional 200,000 children out of poverty.

Secondly, it is no good the Prime Minister saying that he now supports the principle that people on high incomes should not get child benefit, because before the election he supported the opposite principle and said quite clearly to families up and down this country, â€œIâ€™m not going to take away your child benefit.â€ In my book there is a very simple word for that: a broken promiseâ€”it is a broken promise by this Prime Minister.  They are right: there are two broken promises. The reality is that lower-income families are losing their tax credits   and middle-income families are losing their child benefit. Does the Prime Minister understand why people just do not believe him when he says, â€œWeâ€™re all in this togetherâ€?",Edward Miliband,"I think that it is time the right hon.

The Opposition support that because we believe it will strengthen the moderate voices among the Palestinians who want to pursue the path of politics, not the path of violence. I urge the Prime Minister to consider adopting that position in the days ahead.",Edward Miliband,"I agree with the right hon. Gentleman on the first part of what he said: confidence is dwindling that there is time left for a two-state solution. That is why there is such a sense of urgency in the international communityâ€”this could be the last chance for peace, because the facts on the ground are changing. Frankly, I think it is so much in Israelâ€™s interest now to push for the two-state solution, so we should keep up the pressure.On the potential vote at the United Nations, our view, which I know the Foreign Secretary set out for the House in some detail yesterday, is that the Palestinians should not take it to the UN in the short term, and we have urged them not to do that. Clearly, if they do so, we will have to consider the right way to vote. The point is this: we will not solve this problem at the United Nations; it will be solved only by Israelis and Palestinians sitting down and negotiating. Indeed, there may be dangers in pushing the issue too early at the UN in terms of funds for the Palestinian Authority being cut off and all the other consequences, so let us get negotiations going, rather than discussions at the UN.",21/11/2012,0.3248,,,,

Meanwhile, another report, Project Hero, is secretly considering lifting interest rates on previous graduate loans.

First, the number of children from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university is higher than it has ever been, so that is a good step forward. Secondly, if we want to get children from disadvantaged backgrounds into universities, we should be supporting things like the academies programme and free schools. We saw in Labourâ€™s announcement this week that they are now  saying that they support free schools. That is great. The trouble is they then went on to say that they are not going to allow any more of them. Then they said this, which is quite extraordinary:â€œWhat we will have is a new academies programme including parent-led academies, really good teacher-led academies like Peter Hymanâ€™s school in east Londonâ€.They want more schools like that.

When will the Prime Minister abandon this shambolic Tory Brexit and develop a plan that delivers for the whole country?",Jeremy Corbyn,"I am interested that the right hon. Gentleman chose to support Baldrick. Of course, the actor who played Baldrick was a member of the Labour party, as I recall. I will tell the right hon. Gentleman what we are going to deliver.

Inviting a relative of each of those killed in Iraq and Afghanistan would have taken up fewer than a third of the 2,500 seats at that event.

He has also in his time and the work he has done on anti-Semitism performed a very important role: he has had a relentless drive to stamp out anti-Semitism and, indeed, intolerance in all its forms in our communities, and he should be proud of his record and the work that I know he will continue to do as a champion on this issue.My right hon. Friend is right to highlight Bradfordâ€”of course, he has a particular knowledge of that cityâ€”and I think that people will be rightly disappointed to see the Liberal Democrats readopt a candidate with a questionable record on anti-Semitism.

Gentleman only last week, I think, when questions were raised on the matter, that two further public sector pay review bodiesâ€”for prison officers and for police officersâ€”were to report and the Government had to respond to them. They reported and made their recommendations, and as we have accepted the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies across the public sector,  we accepted them for those two groups of workers. We also recognise, as I have said to him previously, that we need to balance out protecting jobs in the public sector, being fair to public sector workers, and being fair to taxpayers who pay for it, many of whom are public sector workers. There is a need for greater flexibility as we look at these issues of public sector pay in the future.

In our housing White Paper, we were very clear that this meansâ€œwhen theyâ€¦have examined fully all other reasonable options for meetingâ€¦identified developmentâ€needs. Of course, that includes looking at and building on brownfield sites.

A motion in this House last November, which received unanimous cross-party supportâ€”the vote was 288 to zeroâ€”called on the Government in London to do the right thing.

In contrast, we have a UK Government who have to be shamed into providing free school meals, who will clap for nurses but will not give them a fair wage, and who plough billions into a nuclear arsenal that sits redundant on the Clyde. Does the Prime Minister understand that the Scottish people are best served by a Government who live up to their valuesâ€”a Government who prioritise bairns not bombs?",Ian Blackford,"I think what the people of Scotland need and deserve is a Government who tackle the problems of education in Scotland, a Government who address themselves to fighting crime and drug addiction in Scotland, and a Government who can wean themselves off their addiction to constitutional change and constitutional argument, because they seem, in the middle of a pandemic when the country is trying to move forward together, to be obsessed with nothing elseâ€”nothing elseâ€”but breaking up the country and a reckless referendum.",17/03/2021,0.1417,,,,
57918,"Following on from that theme, patients in England have unfettered access to specialist hospital care anywhere in England, including within world-leading centres of excellence, but my constituents in north Wales have no such automatic choice, with access dependent on restrictive contracts or individual funding requests. So will my right hon. Friend do all he can to ensure that healthcare features prominently within the UK levelling-up agenda? (900373)",Dr James Davies,"Yes. I thank my hon. Friend for his point, and he knows a great deal about the subject. We have worked very hard with the Welsh Government throughout the pandemic, supporting them with Â£8.6 billion of additional funding through the Barnett formula, but clearly we need to learn the lessons together as we bounce forward from this pandemic.",19/05/2021,0.104,,,,
58065,"This year thousands of children will die because of the Governmentâ€™s dramatic cuts in international aid. Top lawyers in the country advise us that this policy is unlawful, and it has never been presented to this House for approval. When the Prime Minister was previously asked about this by my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell), he suggested that the estimates vote would be the appropriate vote, but that does not allow us to increase the amount of spending  on this aid. I ask the Prime Minister again: when are we going to get a binding vote on the Governmentâ€™s aid policy?",Mr David Davis,"I am grateful to my right hon. Friend, but I am assured by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House that the House was given a chance to vote on this matter in the estimates votes, but it mysteriously chose not to.",07/07/2021,0.2428,,,,
58212,"Q4.  The Prime Minister will know that my hon. Friend the Member for Wolverhampton South West (Stuart Anderson) and I have both lobbied for funding for better training and skills provision for young people in Wolverhampton. The youth unemployment rate was unacceptably high pre-pandemic; now, sadly, it is the highest rate nationally. Will the Prime Minister urgently look at how the Government can level up opportunity so that young people in Wolverhampton can get the skills and the confidence that they need to find work? (903885)",Jane Stevenson,"My hon. Friend is absolutely right about Wolverhampton; that is why we are working flat out to ensure that young people in Wolverhampton benefit from the kickstart scheme, and we are working with City of Wolverhampton Council to ensure that young people get bespoke support for their return to work.",27/10/2021,0.4123,,,,
58359,"Q3.  The chaos of this Government is a distraction from the serious decisions they should be taking. We all know that the Chinese Government deny basic human rights to Chinaâ€™s minority religious communities. The repression of the predominantly Muslim Uyghur population in Xinjiang has been condemned as an act  of genocide. In the face of these abuses, President Biden has decided that US diplomats will boycott the Beijing Olympics. New Zealand and Australia have followed suit. It is international Human Rights Day on Friday, so will the Prime Minister raise his eyes from his chaos and commit the UK to joining the diplomatic boycott, or does his desperation for trade deals trump human rights? (904645)",Kirsten Oswald,"No, because we make all those points regularly to the Chinese. Indeed, I did to President Xi when I talked to him recently. As I have said before, we do not support sporting boycotts, but there are certainly no plans for Ministers to attend the winter Olympics.",08/12/2021,0.085,,,,
58506,"The Prime Minister will know that many families throughout the United Kingdom are struggling with the increased cost of living and rising energy costs, but in Northern Ireland that is compounded by the protocol. The cost of bringing goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland has increased by 27%â€”when we can get access to those goods. It is costing business Â£2.5 million every day, which is almost Â£1 billion a year. That is the cost of the protocol. The Prime Minister talks about uniting this nation and levelling up; he could do that by removing the Irish sea border and fully restoring Northern Irelandâ€™s place in the UK internal market.",Sir Jeffrey M. Donaldson,"I support passionately the right hon. Gentlemanâ€™s indignation. Yes, I never thought, when we negotiated, that it would mean 200 businesses would stop supplying Northern Ireland, foods being blocked and Christmas cards being surcharged. Frankly, the EU is implementing the protocol in an insane and pettifogging way. We need to sort it out and I completely support what the right hon. Gentleman says.",26/01/2022,0.2036,,,,
58653,"Q10.  It is nice to see the Prime Minister back in his place; I missed him last week. A fantasy castle, perhaps Snow White, too, and certainly girls, girls, girls were promised at a partyâ€”less burlesque, more Berlusconi. According to a former Minister, it seems that the Prime Minister has been entertained at these bunga bunga parties, hosted by his close friend, a Russian oligarch. Given that his many weaknesses could leave him open to blackmail, why does the Prime Minister think that MI6 may not entirely trust him? (906249)",Matt Western,"Last week, I was not here to benefit from one of the hon. Gentlemanâ€™s elaborately confected questions. I admire his style, but I am afraid that I simply fail to detect any crouton of substance in the minestrone of nonsense that he has just spoken.",23/03/2022,0.2284,,,,
58800,"Does the Prime Minister agree that when the Leader of the Opposition spins his myth of a low tax Labour party, he clearly needs a memory jog?  May I remind Labour Members that in 2019 they all stood on a manifesto that would have inflicted the highest tax burden on the people of this country in peacetimeâ€”and that is probably why there are so few of them over there on the Labour Benches?",Jill Mortimer,"Yes, Labour campaigned to put up taxes on business to the highest level this country has ever seen; that was the Leader of the Oppositionâ€™s ambition, and that is what they would do again. Be in no doubt, that is what they love to doâ€”we can feel the lust for tax rising off those Opposition Benchesâ€”and that is why there has never been a Labour Government who left office with unemployment lower than when they came in.",25/05/2022,0.6046,,,,
