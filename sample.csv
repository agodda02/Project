117,"On a point of order, Mr. Speaker. Question No. 93, which is in my name and is a similar Question to this, was transferred to the Lord Privy Seal. Could it not be answered as well? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that President Reuther was convinced that the first step towards showing everybody's good faith was to have free elections in every sector of Berlin, and could that be kept in mind as a suggestion when the Powers meet? Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that President Reuther was convinced that the first step towards showing everybody's good faith was to have free elections in every sector of Berlin, and could that be kept in mind as a suggestion when the Powers meet?","Sir J. Lucas","Of course, that is the proposal we made as long ago as the very first discussion we had four or five years ago. It would be very agreeable if it could take place.",1961-08-01,0.20316166
234,"Would it be a fair statement of the Government's position to say that consultation with the Commonwealth has been equally close or equally distant in respect of Common Market negotiations and the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, and vice versa?","Mr. M. Foot","No, Sir. In reference to these negotiations, I see that the Prime Minister of Australia, and now the Prime Minister of Canada, have recognised in public speeches that we have tried, over the long period that this matter has been under discussion, to keep the fullest consultation and information with our Commonwealth friends.",1961-11-16,0.2800667
351,"As public expenditure is a matter of very great concern to the House, and as the Chief Secretary is a member of the Cabinet and the Financial Secretary is not, should not hon. Members on both sides have the chance to ask Questions of the Chief Secretary who, otherwise, will not appear at Question Time at all?","Mr. Jay","I think that this will work itself out in the most convenient way if Questions are put to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It just so happens that there has not been a Thursday recently on which the Treasury Questions have been reached.",1961-12-05,0.15021236
468,"Would the Prime Minister answer two questions arising out of the communiqué issued after the talks? Firstly, can he say whether the discussions about the possible resumption of nuclear tests were concerned with joint testing by the United States and the United Kingdom, or with testing by the United States alone? Secondly, can he say whether, in fact, a request was made by the United States Government for facilities on Christmas Island?","Mr. Gaitskell","I should not like to go further than the communiqué at the present time. At the earliest possible moment I will make a further statement.",1962-01-23,0.06474928
585,"Will the Prime Minister bear in mind that Mr. Khrushchev made it plain in his letter that he was not proposing another Summit Conference, but simply that the Heads of State would be associated with these vitally important negotiations? Is not this fundamentally very much the same idea as President Kennedy and the Prime Minister himself proposed in their letter to Mr. Khrushchev?","Mr. Gaitskell","There are, of course, similarities; but we do feel that, although a formal meeting of eighteen Prime Ministers—to make, no doubt, eighteen speeches, which would take quite a time—may be valuable, what is important in our proposal is the practical meeting of the three nuclear Powers, which have rather special responsibilities. Our problem is how to try to make a workable plan which will get the best of both, and we are considering our reply.",1962-02-13,0.17147449
702,"In retrospect, can the Prime Minister recall that not long ago this House passed the Overseas Service Act which made generous provision for a great many overseas civil servants? I think I am right in saying that that will cost this country about£160 millions over ten years. Therefore, a great deal has been done about which we may be proud.","Sir H. Oakshott","Yes, Sir. It would be a great mistake if it were to go outside this House that the Houses of Parliament have not been willing to accept very heavy responsibilities.",1962-03-01,0.16630189
819,"asked the Prime Minister whether, in view of public interest throughout Wales in a revision of the leasehold laws he will state the terms of his reply to the letter he has received from the Methodist Church in South Wales on the subject of leasehold reform.","Mr. G. Thomas","The letter to which the hon. Member refers was acknowledged on my behalf. I have noted the views expressed in it and passed them on to my right hon. Friend  the Minister of Housing and Local Government who has the matter under consideration.",1962-03-27,0.081659436
936,"asked the Prime Minister whether the speech of the Lord Privy Seal to the Ministerial Meeting of Western European Union on 10th April represents the policy of Her Majesty's Government.","Mr. H. Wilson","Yes, Sir.",1962-04-19,-0.002397313
1053,"I express my appreciation of the right hon. Gentleman's courtesy in answering my Question. I never thought that his refusal to answer was prompted by anything but a desire to serve the convenience of the House. Does he realise that very few people in this country, if any, wish to be stampeded into an unnecessary or perilous war, in the way that we were stampeded by our allies in the case of Korea? In the South East Asia Treaty Organisation is not it a prerequisite to action, first, that there should be a request for assistance by the country concerned, and, secondly, that there should be prior consultation among the parties to the Treaty? Is it not the case that the Americans have landed troops in a country, in purported pursuance of their duties or rights under the Treaty, when neither of these prerequisite conditions had in fact occurred?","Mr. Silverman","If the hon. Member is referring to the landing of troops in Thailand, that is an entirely different matter, and it is one about which I hope to be able to speak to the House in a few moments' time.",1962-05-17,NULL
1170,"asked the Prime Minister what agreement he reached with President de Gaulle on the subject of Great Britain's willingness to renounce Commonwealth preferences and acquiesce in the formation of a French nuclear striking force as part of the price for entering the Common Market.","Mr. Zilliacus","I would refer the hon. Members to the Answer which I gave to the hon. Member for Glasgow, Govan (Mr. Rankin) on 5th June.",1962-06-07,NULL
1287,"Does not this proposal about detection offer by far the best opportunity of reaching a solution, or at any rate a partial solution, of this very vexed problem? Can the right hon. Gentleman say whether the reports which appeared in several newspapers this morning that conversations to this effect, albeit of an informal character, have already taken place in Geneva, and will he encourage the British delegate there—I understand that it is the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs—to express, so far as is practicable, a conciliatory opinion?","Mr. Shinwell","I think that what we all hope to get is a successful negotiation. I hope the House will feel that we have tried to negotiate in the way most likely to get results. I am not able to say today how far the possibility of not having to have the inspection system on Russian soil alters the question whether certain on-site inspections will still be required as part of any treaty. All this is being carefully examined, and we hope to make progress.",1962-07-17,NULL
1404,"In view of President Kennedy's statement yesterday that the Americans are to carry out three more high altitude tests and in view of Mr. Khrushchev's announcement of the intention of his Government to carry out high altitude tests, may I ask the Prime Minister whether any further proposals have been agreed between him and President Kennedy with a view to expediting the achievement of a nuclear test ban treaty and so end the need for these tests?","Mr. Henderson","We have very close communication on this subject which, as the right hon. and learned Gentleman knows, is now being discussed at Geneva. I hope that we may be able to make some valuable proposals.",1962-08-02,NULL
1521,"Is not part of the difficulty caused by the fact that the two Departments are not combined, which necessarily means an exceptionally heavy burden on the Secretary of State? Will the Prime Minister consider whether the time has not come—since he seems unlikely to separate the two again—when they should be properly integrated so that the civil servants can share the burden?","Mr. Gaitskell","Yes, Sir. I think that steps to closer co-operation are being taken and we may at some point be able to take a further step. This seems the best way to start the experiment.",1962-11-22,NULL
1638,"Would not the Prime Minister put an end to the doubts and misgivings which obviously exist by stating quite clearly that the Government are opposed to the creation of a European, N.A.T.O. or Common Market nuclear force and stand with the United States in demanding unified control of any such force?","Mr. Zilliacus","I am glad to see that on this matter the hon. Member ranges himself beside General de Gaulle.",1962-12-13,NULL
1755,"Can the Prime Minister give any indication how far Her Majesty's Government have gone in their policy to facilitate talks on Kashmir and the differences between India and Pakistan?","Mr. Donnelly","As the hon. Member probably knows, these talks are continuing, and we must hope for their success.",1963-02-05,NULL
1872,"Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that there is at present considerable competition on his own side on the need for finding an immediate successor to him? Will he provide facilities for that?","Mr. Shinwell","No, Sir. The difficulty about the whole problem raised in these questions is that there appears to be equal anxiety on the part of some people to go to the House of Lords and on the part of others to come back to the House of Commons. But we must find a way through.",1963-02-21,NULL
1989,"Would my right hon. Friend use any influence which he may have with the Leader of the Opposition and ask him to persuade the four Socialist-controlled councils in the immediate vicinity of Cardiff which have consistently refused to sell freeholds to sitting leasehold occupiers⤔","Mr. Box","I will do what I can through the usual channels.",1963-03-12,NULL
2106,"Did the Prime Minister say just now, or did we mishear him, "if the remarks of the Lord Privy Seal are of any value"? Is not that a rather ominous remark?","Mr. Driberg","I said, "if they were of any value" in relation to the Question. That is what I meant. I have read this report as closely as I can but I cannot find this point. I will look at the report again. It is very long.",1963-04-02,NULL
2223,"asked the Prime Minister if he is aware that the late Mr. H. V. Pennells was wrongly blamed in Command Paper No. 2009; and whether he will cause further inquiries to be made especially from those who knew him.","Commander Kerans","I have no evidence for thinking that the Tribunal was mistaken in its conclusions about the late Mr. Pennells; but it is important to see these conclusions in proper perspective. The Tribunal considered that Mr. Penells was remiss and lacking in judgment in not taking effective action, notwithstanding warnings from the Foreign Office, to seek a review of the system of selecting subordinate staff for naval attachés behind the Iron Curtain. But it said that it would be unjust to conclude that Mr. Pennells had been negligent of his public duty, and it commented that in general he was efficient and conscientious and served the Admiralty well.",1963-05-02,NULL
2340,"In view of the very startling statement made in this report of British scientists, have the Government specifically asked the American Government for an assurance that they would not embark on such tests without consultations with us?","Mr. M. Foot","No, Sir. I should not try, and I should not lend myself to trying, to prevent something if it is really of great national security importance.",1963-05-28,NULL
2457,"asked the Prime Minister if he will arrange, that when complex legislation is presented to the House, particularly a Finance Bill, a detailed explanatory memorandum is published in the form of a White Paper.","Mr. O'Malley",":There would be great practical difficulties in producing a detailed memorandum explaining all the proposals covered by a typical Finance Bill to coincide with the publication of the Bill. On the other hand, on the occasion of the Finance Bill, 1962, a White Paper was issued explaining the provisions relating to short-term gains and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will continue to bear in mind the possibility of publishing, at a reasonable interval after the publication of the Bill itself, a memorandum about unusually complicated sections of the Bill.",1963-07-04,NULL
2574,"asked the Prime Minister whether he will take steps to enable the House in future to discuss the reports of the Ecclesiastical Committee on Measures presented by the Church Assembly for its consideration, so that hon. Members may have the opportunity of expressing their opinions before being presented with a completed Measure which they have the option of approving or rejecting but not of amending.","Mr. John Page","No, Sir. I do not think it would be right for the Government to take an initiative of this kind.",1963-07-25,NULL
2691,"Can the right hon. Gentleman explain in what capacity the Lord Chancellor appeared on the platform at the Tory Party conference in October? Will he say in what capacity the noble Lord addressed the German judges a few months ago, a speech in which he made a violent attack on the Leader of the Opposition in this House? Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that this is the way to teach German judges the impartiality of the judiciary? I am asking a question of the Prime Minister, Sir, and I should very much like an answer to it.","Mr. Hamilton",rose—,1963-11-21,NULL
2808,"Is the Prime Minister aware that, with due respect to my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, the usual channels on my side are somewhat conservative? Would he consider on occasion establishing a new channel?","Mr. Donnelly","I do not think I can give the hon. Member much hope, because a lot more people will be going Conservative in future.",1963-12-12,NULL
2925,"Surely my right hon. Friend will agree that democracy requires that there should be the fullest expression in the newspapers of every point of view? Since this cannot be done unless we have a widely diverse type of Press, ought not this to be looked at again?","Sir C. Osborne","It is very difficult. This is a genuine difficulty, as I think the whole House would find. We might be able to stop the acquisition of one newspaper by another, through, let us say, an amalgamations court. But how? If an amalgamation is stopped, we cannot say that the newspaper we wish to save will continue to exist. That is the difficulty.",1964-01-21,NULL
3042,"Are we to understand that the promise given in Standing Committee by the Minister of Defence to my right hon. Friend the Member for Easington (Mr. Shinwell), that three Ministers of Defence for the individual Services would be appointed, will be included in the Order in Council?","Mr. Bellenger","I should not like to say what will be included in the Order in Council. I gather that, whatever is put into an Order in Council or whatever is in present legislation, technically these Ministers will be Ministers of State, but they can be given any title and be paid salaries appropriate to their status.",1964-02-06,NULL
3159,"In giving full support to American policy in South Viet-Nam, did the Prime Minister receive any return assurances from President Johnson that the American Government intended to bring their war in Viet-Nam to an end and to seek a policy based on the Geneva Agreements of 1954?","Mr. Warbey","The whole purpose of this help to the South Viet-Nam Government is to bring these operations to an end, but there is a continuous infiltration of Communists from the north.",1964-03-03,NULL
3276,"Is not the Prime Minister aware that in the week before the Easter Recess we had Answers from the Minister of Health, the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland and the Leader of the House on the question of the World Health Centre which were completely contradictory? In those circumstances does he think that there is something to be said for co-ordinating arrangements in this case? Would he care to take the opportunity to state categorically whether, with the proviso which he has just mentioned, the Government support this idea?","Mr. K. Robinson","We have asked the Director-General of the World Health Organisation to give further consideration of this matter of the international laboratory because as a result of the international discussions the great majority of countries including our own, have not felt that it is desirable at present.",1964-04-07,NULL
3393,"As the Secretary of State for Scotland has committed the Government to a plan to abolish slums in Scotland, will the Prime Minister tell us what time it will take to wipe out the slums that now exist in Glasgow?","Mr. Rankin","The Secretary of State gave the best indication that he could when he said that we aim to do it in 10 years, but it may take longer, of course.",1964-04-23,NULL
3510,"Is not there a strong case for putting on historical record all the facts, not only with regard to the military operations which took place, but also with regard to the political events which led up to the opening of the campaign? Is not this essential in view of the doubts and suspicions which undoubtedly exist on this question?","Mr. A. Henderson","I think that I have answered the right hon. Gentleman's question. I do not think that there is a case for an inquiry.",1964-05-14,NULL
3627,"Will my right hon. Friend agree that the R.A.F., which is there to support B.A.O.R., is equipped with nuclear weapons of British manufacture?","Mr. Hastings","Yes, Sir. The bomber deterrent force has British warheads.",1964-06-25,NULL
3744,"Is the right hon. Gentleman aware that we shall all be gratified to know that in the days of Lord Attlee's Administration not only the country but the House was three times as satisfied with its Prime Minister as it is today? Are we now to take it that the figures given by the right hon. Gentleman will be a real sign of the ineffectiveness of the Conservative Opposition after October?","Mr. H. Wilson","I think the right hon. Gentleman had better wait and see, but I seem to remember that Lord Attlee was defeated.",1964-07-16,NULL
3861,"Does my right hon. Friend recognise the importance of increasing the power and effectiveness of the control of the Legislature over the Executive? As in recent weeks he has rightly strengthened the power and the effectiveness of the Executive, to the extent that he does not do something similar for the Legislature he is increasing the gulf between the two. Does he regard that as wholly desirable?","Mr. Hamilton","As a former Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I can say that my hon. Friend is preaching to the converted on this matter. The whole House will be aware of the tremendously increased impact of the Select Committee on Estimates in the last two or three years and of the very valuable work done in that Committee by the appointment of members of the Clerks' staff to work on that Committee. However, this is still an open question and I would have thought that the right place to consider it would be the Select Committee on Procedure.",1964-11-12,NULL
3978,"Can the Prime Minister say what security screening is given to these outside advisers and whether they are allowed to see any classified documents without being screened? Will he advise the advisers that the contradictory briefings given last weekend about the strength of B.A.O.R. are not helpful to anyone?","Mr. Goodhart","Exactly the same security considerations apply here as applied with the previous Government. There has been no change whatsoever in this respect. But I would make this point, because this is a problem which faced the previous Government as well as the present one. There are difficulties about the question of information officers in all Departments, and I think that there is a general desire, which I believe was shared by the previous Government, that we must try to do something towards working out a better form of career service in this field. Of course, it will be essential all the time to keep on recruiting those with journalistic experience, and this is highly desirable. But it would be a good thing if we were able—this is what we are trying to do—to work out a system of recruiting young journalists with short journalistic experience and bring them into a career service and, on occasion, as all Governments have done, to recruit them on a short—service commission basis.",1964-12-03,NULL
4095,"When this meeting is held, will my right hon. Friend consider making proposals for a reduction in military expenditure in view of the crippling effect that this is having on our economy?","Mr. Evans","I think that one of the most important questions which the whole House has agreed should be discussed at the earliest opportunity, both with our allies in N.A.T.O. and of course in any East-West discussion, is the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I imagine that this would be a very important subject for discussion and I would feel also that the question, over a period of time, of a reduction of forces and weapons on both sides of the Iron Curtain is something which is of mutual interest to both East and West.",1965-02-02,NULL
4212,"asked the Prime Minister whether he will give an assurance to the Government of India that in the event of that country being invaded by armed forces the British Government will give both military and economic aid independent of the action of the United Nations.","Viscount Lambton","I would refer the hon. Gentleman to my answer to the Question put by the hon. Member for Bury St. Edmunds (Mr. Eldon Griffiths) on 4th February. Any action we should take in such circumstances would be in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter and would, we hope, be supported by the Organisation.",1965-02-23,NULL
4329,"Would the Prime Minister answer a simple and non-controversial question on this matter? I know that he is aware that, rightly or wrongly, there has been criticism of the amount of consultation which has taken place. That criticism has come from the House of Commons and from both sides of the steel industry. Is the right hon. Gentleman satisfied that the amount of consultation which has taken place is adequate?","Mr. Iain Macleod","Yes, Sir. My right hon. Friend is perfectly willing to meet anyone who wishes to be consulted on this question. He has been willing throughout, and if there has not been more consultation it is because it has not been asked for.",1965-03-16,NULL
4446,"Does the Prime Minister still believe that the proportion of our trade with the Commonwealth could be greatly increased or does not he now think it likely that, over a long period, it will continue to decline, as was persuasively argued in his pamphlet, "Why Britain should enter the Common Market", written a couple of years ago by the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations?","Mr. Chataway","I am glad the hon. Gentleman is widening his reading. I should be very sorry to feel that he was really as defeatist about increasing Commonwealth Trade as he suggests. For some years now, there has been a decline, and it is regrettable that the decline accelerated in the past four or five years. I am not underestimating the difficulties of reversing the decline. I wish that somebody had started on it  a bit earlier; that is all. We shall certainly do what we can to halt the decline and reverse the trend, and I should not like to begin approaching the problem with the pessimism of the hon. Gentleman.",1965-04-01,NULL
4563,"Can the right hon. Gentleman tell us what is the precise rôle of the Paymaster-General in this particular matter?","Mr. Stainton","I may even have something to say on that subject when I am free to make a statement on security. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will realise that this Government, on coming into office, decided to set on foot all the arrangements necessary so that we should never again have a situation of a Prime Minister saying that he had never been told about security matters that had been common knowledge for three months.",1965-05-06,NULL
4680,"How can we operate air power east of Suez without the strongest reconnaissance aircraft with a range of 1,500 miles? If this is not to be another example of the Prime Minister's double standards, surely we have no alternative but to buy the F.111 with our scarce money resources?","Mr. Ridsdale","The double standards arise in the pretence that we have got the TSR2 or that it would be available in the time required. As my right hon. Friend and I have made clear many times, we are going through a very intensive review of our rôles in different possible theatres in relation to the cost, something which apparently our predecessors never did.  This is clear in view of the escalation of defence costs in the last year or two. As soon as this is clear, I hope that we shall be able to report to the House about our conclusions. The answer I gave to the first question represents the position of the Government as at present until the review is completed.",1965-05-25,NULL
4797,"Is not the Prime Minister aware of the mounting tide of criticism in this country and that people are going about saying, "Don't blame me, I voted Conservative"? Is he preparing to get the Ministers, all 119 of them, to write to the Press to reply to this criticism?","Sir Knox Cunningham","The hon. Gentleman and I live in two different countries. The fact that people who voted Conservative and are prepared to admit to it are now saying so is not a sign of any change  of opinion on their part or that of anybody else. However, I am a little surprised that they should be using slogans borrowed from or reproduced from an American slogan, "Don't blame me, I voted Goldwater".",1965-06-22,NULL
4914,"Arising out of the supplementary question asked by the hon. Member for Ebbw Vale (Mr. Michael Foot), may I ask the right hon. Gentleman whether he accepts that if the Government recognise that the problem is one of integration and that that is the angle to be tackled, and not one of restriction, and he resists the short-term political prejudices which are sweeping certain parts of the House, he will be warmly applauded for taking action which recognises the economic importance of these immigrants and the vital rôle of Britain in the centre of a multi-coloured Commonwealth?","Mr. Thorpe","My advice to the hon. Gentleman is to await the statement and the White Paper. I have said that the White Paper and the statement will deal fully with the problems of assimilation and integration as well as with certain questions which have arisen about the effectiveness of the controls and evasion. The White Paper will, I hope, be comprehensive in its scope, and I ask the hon. Gentleman to await it.",1965-07-08,NULL

5148,"Would not the Prime Minister agree that, while everybody has a right to protest to the B.B.C. about its conduct, it is extremely important that we should encourage and support independent decisions by the B.B.C. and that we in political parties should not try and decide what is appropriate or inappropriate in this type of broadcast? If the broadcasting authorities go seriously wrong, no doubt the matter can be raised in debate, but surely the more decisions the B.B.C. takes independently on as many points as it likes, the better.","Mr. Grimond","Certainly. I am aware that there have not been many complaints about the performance of Independent Television and, indeed, the impartiality shown in all these matters by the Chairman. But I think that the ground rules, if there must be ground rules, should be worked out by consultation between the principal parties in this House and then by the television authorities.

5382,"Will the right hon. Gentleman give a clear answer, yes or no? If he decides to purchase the F111, will it increase the nuclear delivery capacity of this country or not? In fact, it will.","Mr. Heath","If the right hon. Gentleman will put a clear question, he will get a clear answer. As to the way in which he has now formulated the question, if there were a purchase of another aircraft which had the power to deliver bombs—we have already got the Canberras, as he knows—if there were such a purchase it would increase the power of delivery, but this is going to be internationalised.  The right hon. Gentleman's belief that we have an independent deterrent is, of course, a completely false assumption from the start. What we have will be internationalised with or without any further purchase of aircraft.",1966-01-25,NULL

Of course it is— As soon as we are able to reach agreement with our allies on the form of the Atlantic Nuclear Force. I hope that hon.

5733,"Would the Prime Minister consider setting up within the Estimates Committee an economic policy committee through which we could cross-examine the intentions of the Treasury?","Mr. Gresham Cooke","This is a very bad moment to talk about the intentions of the Treasury when we have not yet heard the Budget statement.

5850,"In view of the perfidious attack by supporters of Marshal Ky upon Buddhists in Da Nang this week, would the Prime Minister seek some clarification of the position of the Government of South Vietnam with regard to the holding of free elections?","Mr. Rose","The question of free elections was raised in a previous  Question this afternoon, and it is our understanding that it is intended to proceed first to an interim stage and then to free elections at a later stage, probably next year. I have made quite plain that our attitude to the question of Vietnam is not dependent on what we may or may not think of individual Ministers of the Government of South Vietnam, including the Prime Minister. There are far bigger issues at stake and all of them could be solved if the parties would get to the conference table.",1966-05-17,NULL
5967,"Is there not a very important point of principle here, in that the functions of the Minister of Labour as a Minister for conciliation—he is responsible under the Act for conciliation and has officers in his Department responsible for conciliation—can conflict with the incomes policy of any Government? In these circumstances, which course is he to pursue? Surely this is a major matter of principle which should be decided by any Government.","Mr. Heath","There would be a conflict if one thought that my right hon. Friend's conciliation duties were simply to split the difference between the  employers and the trade union concerned without regard to the national interest. It must always be the duty of any Government—I am sure that the right hon. Gentleman agrees—to have regard to the third party to every bargain, namely, the public and the national interest.

It is a fact that over the past few years, under successive Governments in this country, the amount devoted to aid has risen quite considerably and pretty steadily. It has increased considerably in the last two years and is still at a record level for this country. In this situation, when we have had to count every penny of overseas expenditure, it was inevitable that some restriction on the increase—not a cut—had to be laid down for aid, although the cut there is very much smaller than is envisaged in the case of defence.",1966-10-25,NULL

That was the whole basis of what we said on those occasions. That was still our view when we discussed it on H.M.S. "Tiger" with Mr. Smith. We had some discussions about whether particular constitutional proposals would be likely after two or three elections, or whatever it was, to lead to majority rule, but, of course, no date was set in our discussions.

In regard to food prices, in one index there was a rise of 1½ per cent. from September to September, but the Financial Times index showed a fall of 1½ per cent. from September to September. The hon.

Examples of this are there for us all to see. The Soviets do it in the air corridors. They do it in the land corridors. They are playing cat and mouse with the Americans in the Caribbean at this moment. They can at any time use the same tactics to menace or threaten traffic in the Indian Ocean. These are the facts. They cannot be wished away. The experience is  there not only in the past, but in recent months.

Friend will be aware that visits to one's constituency do not technically feature as public engagements. Of course, I have recently been to my constituency, as my hon Friend will know, and, of course, the unemployment question has been constantly discussed by my constituents and myself. We have also discussed certain recent cut-backs, for example, in the Post Office programme, and matters of that kind. The unemployment policy was debated fully in the House immediately before Christmas. I have nothing to add to what my right hon.

There is a widespread concern among trade unionists about the ease with which Members of this House blame workers for industrial disputes and automatically exonerate management for their appalling record in these matters. Is my right hon. Friend aware that if any women had been among the 57 workers claiming an extra £1 per week they would have automatically received the rise under the Equal Pay Act, but because men were involved in the dispute, the management seems to be exonerated? Is this not a clear case in which the management is to blame for an industrial dispute?","Mr. Atkinson","In my original answer I paid tribute to the reduction in the number of days lost through disputes—though they are still more than the country can afford. The total time lost through disputes averages two hours per worker per year. I have made clear on a number of occasions that where there is a highly vulnerable situation and where Government money has been voted by this House—even though it was rejected by the Conservatives—it is a very unwise act, which puts the continued supply of Government money and the permanent continuation of employment there severely at risk.

I considered the matter, but in view of Mr. Jay's qualities and high calibre—of which I have seen no criticism at all—I believe that this is an imaginative appointment. The only question is whether I was right in my  judgment and whether, because he is my son-in-law, I should have refused the appointment.

There is a world recession and unemployment is rising elsewhere. In fact, the recession has bitten more deeply in the United States.

If we were ever to give in—to give political status to people who have committed murder and other terrible crimes—we should put at risk the lives of many innocent men, women and children. That is why we shall never do it. In so far as the hunger strike had that objective, it has totally and utterly failed.

In the light of that, can she tell us what we can do to restore to the Treasury that measure of control over good housekeeping by the great spending Departments of State which they lost when the Civil Service Department took charge of promotion at the top end of the Civil Service? Is it not less than coincidental that, since the establishment of the Civil Service Department, public expenditure has spiralled out of control?","Mr. Bruce-Gardyne","I should not necessarily agree with the coincidence to which my hon. Friend refers. I started off being marginally in favour of merging the two Departments but came to the conclusion that if we were to do that, all concentration would go on reorganisation rather than on dealing with the true problem, which my hon. Friend correctly defines as the effective control of public spending. The Select Committee's report had some suggestions to make about that, and we hope to take up some of them, because it is vital that we have that control. As for promotion, the topmost appointments come to both the Secretary of State for the Department concerned and to the Prime Minister of the day.

Alternative energy sources such as harnessing the wind and the tides could meet only a tiny proportion of the great demand for power to keep the wheels of industry turning.

Friend is aware, at the recent European Community Heads of Government meeting we agreed to take positive measures to help the blacks in South Africa and we have allocated a further £15 million over the next five years for that purpose in addition to the £22 million that we are already spending.

It will not help to overman manufacturing industry to the extent of 2 million jobs, even though it is nationalised. That is the right hon. Gentleman's policy — put manufacturing industry back to overmanning and make it less competitive. That is the road to ruination. We must have competitive and sound manufacturing firms. They are.

Is it not the truth that the regulations were drafted in haste and without proper consultation? The Institute of Trading Standards Administration says that the Government have left it to enforce the unenforceable. With a legal touch like that, it is no wonder the Prime Minister gave up the Bar for politics—unlike the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, who sometimes gives up politics for the bar.","Mr. Hague","What the right hon. Gentleman says about the judgment happens to be wrong. It was based on a technicality, and we have been given leave to appeal. As my right hon. Friend the Minister of Agriculture has always said, it is necessary for the ban to  remain until the scientific and medical evidence shows that the threat is receding. In the light of the history of bovine spongiform encephalopathy—the right hon. Gentleman will be familiar with that—it would not be sensible to act contrary to the strong advice of the chief medical officer, which I quoted. If the right hon.

The first meeting of the working group, which was convened in part by Britain, took place a few weeks ago; and, subsequent to that, a series of further meetings have taken place. In addition, Mr. Rugova is now in Washington and has met President Clinton; there will be an attempt to have further dialogue between him and Mr. Milosevic. I want to make it very clear that we are watching the situation in Kosovo extremely carefully. We believe that we cannot afford to have an extension of violence and disorder there— Before, in a similar situation nearby, the international community acted with great firmness, and we must make sure that we do the same again. In answer to the question from the Opposition Benches, "Why bother?" we bother because disorder in that part of the world would have a huge impact on all of us, including this country.",1998-06-03,NULL

The truth of the matter is that the Opposition really do not know where they stand—but they cannot have it both ways.

Indeed, I hear talk that he and his colleagues are so worried about the result that Liberal Democrat peers are being invited to vote against their party's policy and in favour of the Government's. Why does the Prime Minister object so much to giving voters choice and the freedom to express individual views on whom they want to send to the European Parliament? Will he admit that, for him, when it comes to competition between open democracy and central control, democracy loses every time?","Mr. Damian Green","One of the great advantages of having the Home Secretary sitting near me is that he can inform me that the closed list system was pioneered by the previous Government in Northern Ireland.",1998-11-04,NULL

Frankly, we can have that debate without White Papers, but it should be based around the facts. However, the hon.

We are going to deliver the largest hospital-building programme that the health service has ever seen. We will deliver it on cost and on time.

It is no use the hon. Gentleman shaking his head: he is against that extra investment in the health service. He is going to go into the next election— Oh, yes. I am afraid that at some point Conservative Members are going to have to answer a few questions on policy. If they go into the next election holding to their tax guarantee, then, as my predecessor, the former leader of the hon.

But she is also right to point out the success of the Government's measures, in particular the new deal, which has taken 275,000 people off benefit and put them into work. The tragedy is that that policy, which has given us the lowest unemployment levels for 25 years, is opposed by the Opposition, who would scrap that policy were they returned to power.

In addition, we will try, even at this late hour—and it is very late indeed—to make sure that the other countries come together and support us in trying to ensure that we do not just have freer markets in Europe, the United States and Japan but freer non-agricultural market access in the G20 countries, including Brazil and India. However, it is very, very late in the day to secure an agreement, and the next couple of weeks will be critical, particularly in the run-up to the G8 conference.",2006-07-05,NULL

I have served on the school’s governing body since 1979. The pass rate last year was 38 per cent. and this year it is 67 per cent. Furthermore, for the boys, it has gone up from 34 per cent. last year to 73 per cent. this year. Is that yet further evidence of what the Prime Minister meant when he said that the Government were making education their top priority?

Friend’s constituency and the local authority in Barnsley that has done such a superb job. That achievement has been repeated throughout the country, as we have seen the best ever school results. We have moved from a position in which many authorities had a 30 per cent. or lower average of five good GCSEs to one in which we are now ensuring that they are all above 40 per cent. Real improvements are happening in schools up and down the country. It is a wonderful tribute to teachers, staff, pupils and parents, and also to the record investment and reform that the Government have provided.",2006-10-18,NULL

Let me tell him that when he is leaving office, accident and emergency departments are threatened, maternity units are under review and community hospitals are closing. The Prime Minister must be the only person in the country who thinks that patient care is not suffering.Is not the problem the fact that that the Government cannot address the problems of failure at the centre because the person at the centre is a lame duck? Why does the Prime Minister not give us all an early Christmas present, and tell us when he is off?","Mr. Cameron","I hope the right hon. Gentleman will withdraw the claim made by his shadow health spokesman that 29 accident and emergency departments were to close. I have been through this. It is true that many are subject to consultation about changes in provision, but 12 are not even subject to consultation about change.Let us look at what is happening overall. Accident and emergency departments have been transformed from how they were a few years ago. When we came to office, people had to wait for weeks and weeks, sometimes months, to see a cancer consultant. They no longer have to do that. As for cardiac care, people used to die waiting for operations; now people get their operations within three months. People used to wait for more than two years for cataract operations; now the average is three months or less. Moreover, the largest hospital building programme since the inception of the NHS is under way.The fact is that the NHS is getting better. It is getting better under a Labour Government.

As I have also said, I regret having to do this. However, as a result of the measures announced yesterday and those announced by the Chancellor in the Budget, we will now have an extra 9,500 prison places. We will be able to make sure that this is a temporary measure.

At the same time, the Care Quality Commission will look at the standards of health care overall, and look at whether there is an early warning system that could be better in future for dealing with such problems.

The system of taking money away from people and giving it back to  them in tax credits was not working. We say it is better to let people earn more and then take less from them in taxes.

There are 800,000 fewer people in relative poverty than in 2010, and there are 300,000 fewer children in relative poverty since 2010. If he wants to know why, it is because we took difficult decisions to get our deficit down, to get our economy growing and to deliver the strongest growth anywhere in the western world. Tonight, Labour Members have a choice. A week ago, they were committed to getting the deficit down and running a surplus, just like us, but for some reason—I know not why—they have decided to do a 180°-turn and vote for more borrowing for ever.

Of course it is important for us to look at helping people to get their first step on to the housing ladder and ensuring that people are able to have the home that they want. That is why I am pleased that house building has been up under a Conservative Government by comparison with a Labour Government.

Friend that this House should send a very clear message that we will not tolerate anti-Semitism. I have been concerned about the rise in the number of incidents of anti-Semitism in this country. We should very clearly ensure that those incidents of anti-Semitism are properly investigated and dealt with, and that we give the clear message that we will not tolerate it. But that does have to be done by every single political party in this Chamber, and I say to the Leader of the Opposition that given the report of the Home Affairs Committee about anti-Semitism and the approach to anti-Semitism in the Labour party, he needs to think very carefully about the environment that has been created in the Labour party in relation to anti-Semitism.",2016-10-19,NULL

We are giving local authorities more powers to reject intentional unauthorised development, and we will consulting on the details of those proposals in a forthcoming White Paper. I hope he will contribute to those consultations.",2020-02-26,NULL
56862,"My right hon. Friend is rightly engrossed day to day in dealing with the developments of covid-19, but I would like to ask him to cast his mind a little further forward. The chief scientific adviser and the chief medical officer have been clear that the best solution to this is a vaccine, but the chief scientific adviser has said that that could be as much as a year away. He has also suggested that, until that vaccine is available, it may be difficult to ease restrictions successfully. Does my right hon. Friend agree with that analysis, and if so, what does a sensible exit strategy look like?","Mrs Theresa May","The objective of the Government and of our scientific advisers is to depress the peak of the epidemic, to ensure that we get through it, so that we come out on the other side, and that we do that as fast as possible. That is why we are taking all the measures that we have announced. That is why we have announced the package of business support that we have. I am not going to give a timescale on it, but that is the strategy, and I am absolutely certain that it will succeed.",2020-03-18,NULL
56979,"Even before the pandemic began it was clear that the UK has one of the most manifestly inadequate systems of statutory sick pay in the world: we are second from the bottom in European terms, and it continues to shun millions of workers who are low earners, work in the gig economy or are self-employed. As we come back from the crisis in economic terms and make the workplace better, will the Prime Minister agree to work with those of us in the Opposition who want to see a  system that is fit for the 21st century that can meet people’s needs? (903041)","Stewart Malcolm McDonald","Yes, of course, statutory sick pay is an important part of the way we tackle the problems of self-isolation and all the issues faced by people facing coronavirus, but people also receive additional funds. Anybody looking impartially at what we are doing to support the people of this country throughout this epidemic will concede that the UK has done more than virtually any other country on earth to look after the people of this country, whether through the furloughing scheme, the bounce-back loans or anything else. Having listened to the hon. Gentleman, I should say I have also pledged that we are going to put in gigabit broadband across the whole of the UK, so that he can be heard more clearly in future.",2020-06-10,NULL

Friend agree that we need to sustain this community spirit into the future, which means supporting the social infrastructure of local places, such as libraries, youth clubs and community businesses, and it means Whitehall giving away power, so that, finally, local communities can take back control?","Danny Kruger","I thank my hon. Friend for everything he has done to champion the voluntary sector and community spirit over many years. I have followed his campaigns with interest and with support. I think there is now an opportunity to build on the way the nation came together during the covid crisis and to deliver even more of the kind of projects that he wants. We will certainly be putting our support behind those types of community initiatives.",2020-07-08,NULL
57213,"Well, Mr Speaker, I heard what the Prime Minister had to say, but I have to say to him that, yesterday, the chief executive of Care England said,“We were promised weekly testing for staff. That has not been delivered.” Time and again, the Prime Minister makes promises and then breaks those promises. In June, he told this House that“I can undertake…now to get all tests turned around in 24 hours by the end of June.”—The Government have had six months to get this right and yet the Prime Minister still cannot deliver on his promises. The Health Secretary said yesterday that it would take weeks to sort the situation out. Well, we do not have weeks. The Government’s latest figures show that there was an average of 62,000 people tested per day, not 500,000. The Prime Minister has said that testing capacity is at 300,000, but the average is 62,000 a day. How does he explain this?","Angela Rayner","We have delivered on, as I say, the most thoroughgoing testing regime anywhere in Europe. We now have capacity; I think capacity has gone up from—sorry the number of tests per day conducted, not capacity, has gone up from 210,000 last week to 240,000 this week. Just to repeat the statistics, per thousand people, this country is testing 2.54, Germany 1.88, Spain 1.91 and France 1.89. In other words, we are delivering exactly what we said we would do. What is happening is that the British people, quite understandably, are responding to that system with a huge, huge surge in demand, so it is very important that everybody follows the guidance about when they should be getting a test—the guidance sent out by Public Health England, which has been sent to schools, and from NHS Test and Trace.",2020-09-16,NULL

Representing North Norfolk, the constituency with the oldest demographic, I have seen their work at first hand. Yet these professionals often feel forgotten about, and that needs to change. Will he commit to a 10-year plan for social care to match the one for the NHS as the foundation to start reforming social care in this country? (910652)","Duncan Baker","My hon. Friend is absolutely right to highlight the extraordinary work done by carers and social care workers up and down the country. They have got through this pandemic.

But the current piecemeal and environmentally damaging connection method to the national grid is holding us back, as was proven by the Vattenfall judicial review just last week. We need legal and regulatory reform now. Prime Minister, could this be a job for the new Taskforce on Innovation, Growth and Regulatory Reform to help us to implement the much-needed offshore transmission network and meet our net zero targets? (912356)","Duncan Baker","Yes indeed. I congratulate my hon. Friend on his campaign to make his constituency the Riyadh, or possibly the Jeddah, of offshore wind.

They were very articulate about the challenges they have overcome and their concerns for the future, such as finding a job and moving to a new university. Does the Prime Minister have a message for Evie, Jonas, Saul and Lauren, and for other young people thinking about their futures and a life after lockdown? (913879)","Robin Millar","Yes; my message is just to thank them for what they have put up with and to say that I am sorry about how difficult it has been for their generation. I do not think there is any group of young people who have been put through so much and who have had to sacrifice so much in our lifetimes. We owe it to them to repair their education and get them into work as fast as we possibly can.

Friend the Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith) and I have already requested a meeting with the Minister to discuss local concerns from training providers and businesses. What exactly will the Prime Minister do to address that and to safeguard the future of a generation of young people in this country?

I remind the Prime Minister that when I was Director of Public Prosecutions, I prosecuted MPs who broke the rules. He has been investigated by every organisation he has ever been elected to. That is the difference.Billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money handed to their mates and donors; Tory MPs getting rich by working as lobbyists, one not even bothering to turn up because he is in the Caribbean advising tax havens—and the Prime Minister somehow expects us to believe that he is the man to clean up Westminster! He led his troops through the sewers to cover up corruption, and he cannot even say sorry. The truth is that beneath the bluster, he still thinks it is one rule for him and another for his mates. At the same time as his Government are engulfed in sleaze, they are rowing back on the promises they made to the north, and it is working people who are paying the price. Is it any wonder that people are beginning to think that the joke isn’t funny any more?","Keir Starmer","It is plain from listening to the right hon. and learned Gentleman that he seeks to criticise this Government while refusing to explain his own position.

Where were they in the Lobby last night?The Prime Minister’s own MPs have had enough. They will not defend him, they will not turn up to support him, and they will not vote for basic public health measures if he proposes them. At this time of national effort, the Labour party has stood up, shown the leadership that the Prime Minister cannot show, and put the health and security of the British people first.
